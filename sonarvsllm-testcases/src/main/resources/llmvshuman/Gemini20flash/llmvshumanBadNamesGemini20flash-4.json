{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise but lacks context. Method and variable names are not descriptive, making it hard to understand the purpose without additional information. The logic is simple, but the lack of clarity impacts readability.","tokens":234,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and the logic is straightforward, using a ternary operator. However, the method name and variable names are in Portuguese, which impacts readability for non-Portuguese speakers.","tokens":244,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but uses unclear variable names (p, d, s). The logic is somewhat convoluted, especially the string manipulation and the array usage. It could benefit from better naming and a clearer algorithm.","tokens":506,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses portuguese names for variables and methods, making it hard to understand for non-portuguese speakers. The logic is also obscured by the use of seemingly random constants and the lack of clear purpose for the method. The code is hard to read and understand.","tokens":496,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Code is cryptic, method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 is not descriptive, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 is unclear, and the logic is hard to follow without context. Magic numbers are used.","tokens":237,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and the logic is straightforward, implementing a leap year check. The use of modulo operator is clear and the boolean logic is easy to follow. Could be slightly improved with a direct return of the boolean expression.","tokens":278,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Codigo muito simples e direto, com nomes de variaveis claros e sem complexidade. Facil de entender e manter.","tokens":235,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"The code is very simple, uses clear variable names, and performs a straightforward calculation. It\u0027s easy to understand at a glance.","tokens":229,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"Method name \u0027gengibre\u0027 and variable names like \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027 are not descriptive, hindering understanding. The logic itself is simple, but the lack of context and poor naming impacts readability.","tokens":301,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses cryptic names (menta, nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena) making it hard to understand the logic without context. The modulo operations are clear, but the overall purpose is unclear.","tokens":266,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
