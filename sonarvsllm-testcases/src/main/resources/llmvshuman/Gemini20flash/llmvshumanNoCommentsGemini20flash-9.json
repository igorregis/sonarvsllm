{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and easy to understand. It calculates a subtraction of months by using a sum with a negative value. The modulo operator ensures the correct month calculation.","tokens":224,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Extremely clear and concise. Uses a ternary operator effectively for a simple calculation. Method name is self-explanatory. No ambiguity.","tokens":229,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but uses an array with an extra position and string conversions that make it harder to follow. The logic is not immediately clear, and could be simplified.","tokens":510,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is reasonably clear, with good variable names and a straightforward loop. The logic for font selection and data creation is easy to follow. The use of constants like CONTAGEM_FILHOS_PADRAO improves readability. There is a good use of comments and indentation.","tokens":472,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and the logic is relatively straightforward, using ordinal and array access. However, it relies on implicit knowledge of the enum\u0027s order and the division by 3, which might require a bit of thinking to fully grasp.","tokens":243,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and the logic for leap year calculation is clear. The use of modulo operator is standard and easy to understand. No unnecessary complexity.","tokens":266,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Codigo simples e direto, facil de entender. Uso de constante para PI e calculo da area bem claro.","tokens":235,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"Codigo extremamente simples e direto, com nomes de variaveis e funcao auto-explicativos. Calculo da area do triangulo isosceles e trivial.","tokens":240,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clear and concise, using descriptive variable names and standard math operations. The logic is easy to follow, and the method\u0027s purpose is readily apparent. The use of sumWithCompensation is a bit less obvious but still understandable.","tokens":295,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses modulo arithmetic effectively to handle month wrapping. The logic is clear, although the addition of 12 before the final modulo might require a second look to understand its purpose.","tokens":254,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
