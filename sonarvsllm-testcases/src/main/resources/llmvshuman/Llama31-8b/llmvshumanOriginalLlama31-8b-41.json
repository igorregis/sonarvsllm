{"score":"9","reasoning":"Clear and concise Javadoc, good variable naming, and a simple yet effective implementation. The use of modulo to handle negative inputs is a nice touch.","tokens":335,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Clear and concise Javadoc, good use of ternary operator, and method calls are well-named and easy to understand.","tokens":348,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and follows good practices, with clear variable names and comments. However, the use of magic numbers (e.g. 2, 1) and the hardcoded array size could be improved with constants or more dynamic allocation.","tokens":925,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and follows good practices, but some variable names are not in English, which might make it harder for non-Portuguese speakers to understand. The comments are also in Portuguese, which is not a standard practice in Java development.","tokens":558,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-documented and the method name is descriptive. However, the use of ordinal() and ENUMS is not immediately clear without additional context. The logic is straightforward, but could be improved with a more explicit calculation.","tokens":376,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear and concise comments, proper use of Javadoc, and a straightforward logic. However, the condition can be simplified and the else clause is unnecessary.","tokens":336,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear and concise comments in Portuguese, good use of final keyword for constant PI, but variable names could be more descriptive and follow Java naming conventions.","tokens":330,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Clear and concise comments in Portuguese, good variable names, and a straightforward implementation of the formula. The only minor improvement would be to consider adding a check for potential division by zero.","tokens":332,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear and concise comments, good method naming, and proper use of JavaDoc. However, variable names could be more descriptive, and some operations could be extracted into separate methods for better readability.","tokens":326,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear and concise Javadoc, good variable naming, and a straightforward calculation. However, the use of magic numbers (12) and the ordinal() method could be improved for better readability.","tokens":359,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
