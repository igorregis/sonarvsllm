{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is concise but lacks comments and variable names, making it hard to understand the intention and logic behind the subtraction of months.","tokens":221,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear method name, concise logic, and proper use of ternary operator. However, variable names are not provided, making it harder to understand the context.","tokens":237,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is complex and hard to understand due to multiple loops and conditional statements. Variable names are not descriptive, and the logic is not straightforward.","tokens":465,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is mostly clear, but variable names could be more descriptive, and some magic numbers (e.g. 2) could be replaced with named constants for better readability.","tokens":443,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear method name and purpose, concise implementation, but lacks comments or documentation to explain the logic behind the ordinal calculation.","tokens":222,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear method name, concise logic, but unnecessary else clause and return false statement, could be simplified to return the boolean expression directly.","tokens":258,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear method name, good variable naming, and a clear calculation. However, the use of a magic number for PI is a drawback.","tokens":241,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear method name, concise code, and proper variable naming. However, the method name could be more descriptive and the variable name \u0027area\u0027 could be more specific.","tokens":243,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear method name, concise variable updates, and proper use of Math.min and Math.max functions. However, the method name could be more descriptive and the variable updates could be more explicit.","tokens":273,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clever trick with the modulo operator to handle edge cases. However, the variable name \u0027amount\u0027 could be more descriptive, and the use of a magic number (12) could be avoided with a named constant.","tokens":263,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
