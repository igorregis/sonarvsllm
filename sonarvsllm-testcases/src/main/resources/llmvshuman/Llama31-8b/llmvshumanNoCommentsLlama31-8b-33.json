{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is concise but lacks comments and variable names, making it hard to understand the intention and logic behind the subtraction of months.","tokens":221,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear method name and concise logic, but variable names are not provided, making it harder to understand the context.","tokens":228,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is complex and hard to understand due to multiple loops and conditional statements. Variable names are not descriptive, and the logic is not straightforward.","tokens":465,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is mostly clear, but variable names could be more descriptive, and some magic numbers (e.g. 2) could be replaced with named constants for better readability.","tokens":443,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear method name and purpose, concise implementation, but lacks comments or documentation to explain the logic.","tokens":218,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear logic, but unnecessary else clause and return false statement. Could be simplified to a single return statement.","tokens":253,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear method name, good variable naming, and a clear calculation. However, the use of a magic number for PI is not ideal.","tokens":241,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear method name, concise code, and proper variable naming. However, the method name could be more descriptive and the variable name \u0027area\u0027 could be more specific.","tokens":243,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"Clear method name, concise variable updates, and proper use of Math.min and Math.max functions. However, the method name could be more descriptive and the variable updates could be more explicit.","tokens":273,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clever trick with modulo to handle edge cases. However, it assumes a specific implementation of the Month enum, which might not be immediately clear to a reader without additional context.","tokens":255,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
