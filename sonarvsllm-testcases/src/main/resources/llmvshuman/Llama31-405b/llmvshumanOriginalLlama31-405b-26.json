{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. The method name and variable names are clear and descriptive. The Javadoc comment provides a good explanation of the method\u0027s behavior and parameters. The use of the modulo operator to handle the wrap-around is clever and efficient. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is that the method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 could be more descriptive, and the method \u0027soma\u0027 is not shown in this snippet, which might affect the overall understanding.","tokens":407,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, readable, and concise. The method name \u0027getMedia\u0027 is clear, and the Javadoc comment provides a detailed explanation of the method\u0027s behavior, including edge cases. The use of a ternary operator simplifies the code, making it easy to understand. The only reason for not giving a perfect score is that the comment could be slightly shorter while still conveying the same information.","tokens":406,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and follows a clear logic. The use of comments and whitespace makes it easy to read. However, some variable names could be more descriptive, and the method could be broken down into smaller functions for better modularity. Additionally, the use of magic numbers (e.g., 2, 1, 10) could be replaced with named constants for better readability.","tokens":954,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"O código é bem estruturado e fácil de entender, com comentários claros e concisos. As variáveis têm nomes significativos e a lógica é simples de seguir. No entanto, há alguns pontos que podem ser melhorados, como a utilização de constantes mágicas (CONTAGEM_FILHOS_PADRAO, contagemNomes) e a falta de uma descrição mais detalhada do método.","tokens":600,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and has a clear purpose. The method name is descriptive, and the Javadoc comment provides a detailed explanation of the method\u0027s behavior. The use of the ENUMS array and the ordinal() method is clever and efficient. The only reason for not giving a perfect score is that the ENUMS array is not defined in this snippet, which might make it harder for someone to understand the code without additional context.","tokens":420,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, readable, and follows good naming conventions. The method name and variable names are clear and descriptive. The comment explains the purpose of the method and the logic is easy to understand. The only suggestion is to simplify the if-else statement to a single return statement.","tokens":365,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"O código é bem estruturado, com comentários claros e objetivos. A nomenclatura das variáveis é apropriada e o método é conciso e fácil de entender. A única sugestão seria utilizar a constante Math.PI do Java em vez de declarar uma constante própria.","tokens":366,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"O código é bem estruturado, com comentários claros e concisos. A nomenclatura das variáveis é apropriada e o método é simples e fácil de entender. A única sugestão seria considerar a validação dos parâmetros de entrada para evitar erros.","tokens":357,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, readable, and follows Java conventions. The method is clearly documented with a description of its purpose, parameters, and possible exceptions. The variable names are descriptive, and the code is concise. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is that the method \u0027sumWithCompensation\u0027 is not defined in this snippet, which might make it harder to understand for someone without access to the full code.","tokens":376,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, readable, and concise. The method is clearly documented with a description of its behavior, parameters, and return value. The use of a consistent naming convention and the modulus operator to handle edge cases is also a good practice. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is that the variable \u0027ENUMS\u0027 is not defined in this snippet, which might make it harder for someone to understand the code without more context.","tokens":414,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
