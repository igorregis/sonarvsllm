{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method name \u0027paprica\u0027 and variable name \u0027alecrim\u0027 are unclear and don\u0027t follow conventional naming standards. The method \u0027menta\u0027 is not defined in this snippet, making it hard to understand the functionality. The use of a magic number \u002712\u0027 is also unclear without context.","tokens":258,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear ternary operator. However, the variable names are in Portuguese and might be unfamiliar to non-native speakers, which slightly reduces readability. Additionally, the method name \u0027getBrocolis\u0027 doesn\u0027t clearly indicate what the method does.","tokens":265,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is complex and hard to understand due to the use of unclear variable names, multiple loops, and nested conditional statements. The logic is not immediately apparent, and the use of magic numbers (e.g., 2, 10) adds to the confusion. However, the code is well-structured, and the use of String arrays and Integer.valueOf() suggests some level of Java expertise.","tokens":496,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is very hard to understand due to the use of non-standard variable names and lack of comments. The variable names seem to be in Portuguese and are not descriptive, making it difficult for non-Portuguese speakers to comprehend. The code structure is also complex, with multiple nested if-else statements and unclear logic.","tokens":500,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 is unclear and doesn\u0027t follow conventional naming standards. The variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 is also unclear. The calculation \u0027(ordinal() / 3) * 3\u0027 is not self-explanatory and lacks comments. The overall readability is poor due to the unclear names and lack of documentation.","tokens":270,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and has a clear purpose. The condition is a bit complex, but it\u0027s a well-known algorithm for determining leap years. The variable name \u0027a\u0027 could be more descriptive, and the method name \u0027isAB\u0027 doesn\u0027t clearly indicate its purpose. A more descriptive name like \u0027isLeapYear\u0027 would improve readability.","tokens":296,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and easy to understand, with a clear and descriptive method name. The use of a constant for pi is good practice. However, the variable \u0027a\u0027 could be removed and the calculation returned directly, improving readability. Additionally, the constant \u0027P\u0027 could be replaced with \u0027Math.PI\u0027 for better accuracy and adherence to Java standards.","tokens":278,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and easy to understand, with a clear and descriptive method name. However, variable names \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 could be more descriptive, and a comment explaining the formula would improve readability.","tokens":245,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names, such as \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, and \u0027berinjela\u0027, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose of the method and the variables being manipulated. The method name \u0027gengibre\u0027 also doesn\u0027t provide any clear indication of what the method does.","tokens":343,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is hard to understand due to unclear variable names (e.g. nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena) and lack of comments. The method name \u0027menta\u0027 doesn\u0027t indicate its purpose. The use of magic numbers (12) and unclear calculations makes it difficult to comprehend the logic.","tokens":295,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
