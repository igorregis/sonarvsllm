{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. The method name and variable names are clear and descriptive. The Javadoc comment provides a good explanation of the method\u0027s behavior and parameters. The use of the modulo operator to handle the wrap-around is clever and efficient. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is that the method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 could be more descriptive, and the method \u0027soma\u0027 is not shown in this snippet, which might affect the overall understanding.","tokens":407,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, readable, and follows Java documentation standards. The method name is clear, and the Javadoc comment provides a concise explanation of the method\u0027s behavior, including edge cases. The use of a ternary operator simplifies the code, but may be slightly less readable for some developers.","tokens":385,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and follows a clear logic. The use of comments and whitespace makes it easy to read. However, the variable names could be more descriptive, and some methods could be extracted to improve modularity. Additionally, the use of magic numbers (e.g., 2, 1, 10) could be replaced with named constants.","tokens":947,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable, with clear variable names and comments in Portuguese. The use of whitespace and indentation is consistent, making it easy to follow the logic. However, some variable names could be more descriptive, and the magic numbers (e.g., 2, -1) could be replaced with named constants for better clarity.","tokens":575,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and has a clear purpose. The method name is descriptive, and the Javadoc comment provides a detailed explanation of the method\u0027s behavior. The use of the ENUMS array and the ordinal() method is clever and efficient. The only reason it\u0027s not a 10 is that the ENUMS array is not defined in this snippet, which might make it slightly harder to understand for someone not familiar with the codebase.","tokens":422,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, readable, and concise. The method name and variable names are clear and descriptive. The comment explains the purpose of the method and the logic is easy to follow. The only suggestion is to simplify the return statement to a single line: return (ano % 4 \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 ano % 100!\u003d 0) || (ano % 400 \u003d\u003d 0);","tokens":387,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"O código é bem estruturado, com comentários claros e objetivos. A nomenclatura das variáveis é apropriada e o método é conciso e fácil de entender. A única sugestão seria utilizar a constante Math.PI do Java em vez de declarar uma constante própria.","tokens":366,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"O código é bem estruturado, com comentários claros e concisos. A nomenclatura das variáveis e do método é apropriada e segue as convenções Java. A lógica é simples e fácil de entender. A única sugestão seria considerar a validação dos parâmetros de entrada para evitar erros.","tokens":368,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, readable, and follows Java conventions. The method is clearly documented with a description of its purpose, parameters, and possible exceptions. The variable names are descriptive, and the code is concise. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is that the method \u0027sumWithCompensation\u0027 is not defined in this snippet, which might make it harder to understand for someone without access to the full code.","tokens":376,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, readable, and concise. The method is clearly documented with a description of its behavior, parameters, and return value. The use of a consistent naming convention and the modulus operator to handle edge cases is also a good practice. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is that the variable \u0027ENUMS\u0027 is not defined in this snippet, which might make it harder for someone to understand the code without more context.","tokens":414,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
