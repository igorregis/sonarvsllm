{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method name \u0027paprica\u0027 and variable name \u0027alecrim\u0027 are unclear and don\u0027t follow conventional naming standards. The method \u0027menta\u0027 is not defined in this snippet, making it hard to understand the functionality. The use of a magic number \u002712\u0027 is also unclear without context.","tokens":258,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear ternary operator. However, the variable names are in Portuguese and might be unfamiliar to non-native speakers, which slightly reduces readability. Additionally, the method name \u0027getBrocolis\u0027 doesn\u0027t clearly indicate what the method does or what \u0027brocolis\u0027 represents.","tokens":273,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is complex and hard to understand due to the use of unclear variable names, multiple loops, and lack of comments. The logic is also not straightforward, making it difficult to comprehend without additional context or explanation.","tokens":460,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is very hard to understand due to the use of unclear and unrelated variable names, such as \u0027abobora\u0027, \u0027alhoPoro\u0027, \u0027feijaoVerde\u0027, and \u0027inhame\u0027. The method name \u0027coxa\u0027 also doesn\u0027t provide any clue about its purpose. The code seems to be doing some kind of tree node insertion, but the logic is obscure and would require a significant amount of time to decipher.","tokens":524,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The method name \u0027tomilho\u0027 is unclear and doesn\u0027t follow conventional naming standards. The variable \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 is also unclear. The calculation \u0027(ordinal() / 3) * 3\u0027 is not self-explanatory and lacks comments. The overall readability is poor due to the unclear names and lack of documentation.","tokens":270,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and has a clear purpose. The condition is a bit complex, but it\u0027s a well-known algorithm for determining leap years. The variable name \u0027a\u0027 could be more descriptive, and the method name \u0027isAB\u0027 doesn\u0027t clearly indicate its purpose. A more descriptive name like \u0027isLeapYear\u0027 would improve readability.","tokens":296,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and easy to understand, with a clear and descriptive method name. The use of a final variable for pi is good practice. However, the variable \u0027a\u0027 could be directly returned, eliminating the need for an extra variable, and the method name could be more descriptive, such as \u0027calculateArea\u0027.","tokens":272,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and easy to understand, with a clear and descriptive method name. However, variable names \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 could be more descriptive, and a comment explaining the formula would improve readability.","tokens":245,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names, such as \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, and \u0027berinjela\u0027, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose of the method and the variables being updated. The method name \u0027gengibre\u0027 is also unclear. The use of \u0027DoubleSummaryStatistics\u0027 as a parameter type is not explained, and the method\u0027s behavior is not immediately apparent.","tokens":360,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code is poorly readable due to unclear variable names (e.g. nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena) and lack of comments. The method name \u0027menta\u0027 doesn\u0027t indicate its purpose. The use of magic numbers (12) and unclear calculations makes it hard to understand the logic.","tokens":294,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
