{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 is clear, but the variable name \u0027meses\u0027 could be more descriptive. The use of the modulus operator is understandable, but the method \u0027soma\u0027 is not shown, which slightly reduces readability. Overall, the code is concise and easy to follow.","tokens":253,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. The use of a ternary operator simplifies the logic and the variable names are descriptive (getMedia, getContagem, getSoma). The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is the magic number 0.0d, which could be replaced with a named constant for better clarity.","tokens":274,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is somewhat readable, but it has complex logic and multiple loops that make it hard to understand at first glance. Variable names are not very descriptive, and the use of magic numbers (e.g., 2, 10) is not ideal. However, the code is well-structured, and the method name is clear.","tokens":501,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable, with clear variable names and concise comments. The use of whitespace and indentation is consistent, making it easy to follow the logic. However, some variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., \u0027novoNo\u0027 could be \u0027newTreeNode\u0027) and the magic number \u00272\u0027 in the conditional statement could be replaced with a named constant.","tokens":485,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear variable names. The use of the ENUMS array and the ordinal() method is understandable, but might require some knowledge of Java enums and their internal workings. The calculation is simple and easy to follow.","tokens":246,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. The method name is clear and descriptive, and the logic is easy to follow. The use of modulo operators to determine if a year is a leap year is straightforward. The only suggestion for improvement would be to simplify the return statement to a single line, e.g. return (ano % 4 \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 ano % 100!\u003d 0) || (ano % 400 \u003d\u003d 0);","tokens":325,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and easy to understand. The variable names are descriptive, and the calculation is straightforward. The use of a constant for PI is good practice. The only suggestion would be to use the Math.PI constant provided by Java instead of defining a custom constant.","tokens":272,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very concise and easy to understand. The method name is descriptive, and the variable names are clear. The calculation is straightforward, and the return statement is explicit. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is that the method could benefit from a brief Javadoc comment to explain its purpose.","tokens":273,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. Variable names are descriptive, and the method name clearly indicates its purpose. The use of Math.min and Math.max makes the code easy to understand. The only reason it\u0027s not a 10 is that the sumWithCompensation method is not shown, which might make it harder for someone unfamiliar with the code to fully understand its behavior.","tokens":315,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. The use of the modulo operator to handle month wrapping is clear. However, the variable \u0027ENUMS\u0027 is not defined in this snippet, which might make it harder for someone not familiar with the codebase to understand. Additionally, the method name \u0027plus\u0027 could be more descriptive, such as \u0027addMonths\u0027.","tokens":283,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
