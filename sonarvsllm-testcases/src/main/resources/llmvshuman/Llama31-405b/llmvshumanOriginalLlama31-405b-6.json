{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. The method name and variable names are clear and descriptive. The Javadoc comment provides a good explanation of the method\u0027s behavior and parameters. The use of the modulo operator to handle the wrap-around is clever and efficient. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is that the method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 could be more descriptive, such as \u0027subtractMonths\u0027.","tokens":393,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, with a clear and concise method name and a detailed Javadoc comment explaining its behavior, parameters, and return value. The use of a ternary operator simplifies the code, making it easy to read and understand. The only thing keeping it from a perfect score is the lack of explicit null checks or handling for potential edge cases.","tokens":396,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and follows a clear logic. The use of comments and whitespace makes it easy to read. However, some variable names could be more descriptive, and the method could be broken down into smaller functions for better modularity. Additionally, the use of magic numbers (e.g., 2, 1, 10) could be replaced with named constants for better readability.","tokens":954,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable, with clear variable names and comments in Portuguese. The use of whitespace and indentation is consistent, making it easy to follow the logic. However, some variable names could be more descriptive, and the magic numbers (e.g., 2, -1) could be replaced with named constants for better clarity.","tokens":575,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and has a clear purpose. The method name is descriptive, and the Javadoc comment provides a detailed explanation of the method\u0027s behavior. The use of the ENUMS array and the ordinal() method is clever and efficient. The only reason it\u0027s not a 10 is that the ENUMS array is not defined in this snippet, which might make it slightly harder to understand for someone not familiar with the codebase.","tokens":422,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, readable, and follows good naming conventions. The method name and variable names are clear and descriptive. The comment explains the purpose of the method and the logic is easy to understand. The only suggestion is to simplify the return statement to a single line: return (ano % 4 \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 ano % 100!\u003d 0) || (ano % 400 \u003d\u003d 0);","tokens":390,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"O código é bem estruturado, com comentários claros e objetivos. A nomenclatura das variáveis é apropriada e o cálculo é realizado de forma simples e compreensível. A única sugestão seria utilizar a constante Math.PI do Java em vez de declarar uma constante própria.","tokens":371,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"O código é bem estruturado, com comentários claros e concisos que explicam o propósito da função e a lógica utilizada. A nomenclatura das variáveis é apropriada e segue as convenções do Java. A fórmula utilizada para calcular a área do triângulo é correta e fácil de entender. A única sugestão seria considerar a validação dos parâmetros de entrada para evitar resultados inválidos.","tokens":395,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, readable, and follows Java conventions. The method is clearly documented with a description of its purpose, parameters, and possible exceptions. The variable names are descriptive, and the code is concise. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is that the method \u0027sumWithCompensation\u0027 is not defined in this snippet, which might make it harder to understand for someone without access to the full code.","tokens":376,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, readable, and concise. The method is clearly documented with a description of its behavior, parameters, and return value. The use of a consistent naming convention and the inclusion of a clear explanation of the calculation logic also contribute to its high score. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is the use of a magic number (12) which could be replaced with a named constant for even better readability.","tokens":411,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
