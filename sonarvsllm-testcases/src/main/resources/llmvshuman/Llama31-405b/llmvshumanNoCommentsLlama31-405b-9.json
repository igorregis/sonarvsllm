{"score":"8","reasoning":"The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 is clear, but the variable name \u0027meses\u0027 could be more descriptive. The use of the modulus operator is concise, but may require a brief mental calculation to understand. The method call to \u0027soma\u0027 is not shown, which slightly reduces readability.","tokens":253,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. The use of a ternary operator simplifies the logic and the variable names are descriptive (getMedia, getContagem, getSoma). The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is the magic number 0.0d, which could be replaced with a named constant for better clarity.","tokens":274,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is somewhat readable, but it has complex logic and multiple loops that make it hard to understand at first glance. Variable names are not very descriptive, and the use of magic numbers (e.g., 2, 10) is not ideal. However, the code is well-structured, and the method name is clear.","tokens":501,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and readable, with clear variable names and concise comments. The use of whitespace and indentation is consistent, making it easy to follow the logic. However, some variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., \u0027novoNo\u0027 could be \u0027newTreeNode\u0027) and the magic number \u00272\u0027 in the conditional statement could be replaced with a named constant.","tokens":485,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear variable names. The use of ENUMS and ordinal() suggests a well-structured enum-based implementation. However, the magic number \u00273\u0027 could be replaced with a named constant for better readability.","tokens":245,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. The method name is clear and descriptive, and the logic is easy to follow. The use of modulo operators is straightforward, and the conditional statement is simple. The only suggestion for improvement would be to remove the unnecessary \u0027else\u0027 clause and directly return the result of the conditional expression.","tokens":300,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and easy to understand. The variable names are clear and descriptive, and the calculation is straightforward. The use of a constant for PI is good practice. The only suggestion would be to use the Math.PI constant provided by Java instead of defining a custom constant.","tokens":274,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very concise and easy to understand. The method name is descriptive, and the variable names are clear. The calculation is straightforward, and the return statement is explicit. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is that it could benefit from a simple Javadoc comment to explain the purpose of the method and its parameters.","tokens":278,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, concise, and readable. The method name \u0027combine\u0027 clearly indicates its purpose. Variable names are descriptive, and the use of \u0027other\u0027 as a parameter name is a good practice. The operations are straightforward, and the use of \u0027Math.min\u0027 and \u0027Math.max\u0027 makes the code easy to understand. The only reason it\u0027s not a 10 is that the \u0027sumWithCompensation\u0027 method is not shown, which might affect the overall comprehension.","tokens":335,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. The use of the modulo operator to handle month wrapping is clear. However, the variable \u0027ENUMS\u0027 is not defined in this snippet, which slightly reduces readability. Additionally, the method name \u0027plus\u0027 could be more descriptive, such as \u0027addMonths\u0027.","tokens":272,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
