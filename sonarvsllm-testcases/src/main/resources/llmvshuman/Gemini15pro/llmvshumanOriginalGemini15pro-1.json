{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-documented, making it relatively easy to understand. However, using a method named \u0027soma\u0027 (addition) to perform subtraction might be confusing and could benefit from a more descriptive name like \u0027adicionaMeses\u0027 or similar.","tokens":349,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-documented. The use of JavaDoc makes it easy to understand the purpose of the method and any potential caveats. The ternary operator, while compact, doesn\u0027t hinder readability in this case.","tokens":361,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is well-commented in Portuguese, which aids understanding. However, the logic could be simplified. Using String manipulation for arithmetic operations makes it less readable.  A more straightforward approach with integers would enhance clarity.","tokens":943,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code has some good aspects like Javadoc and meaningful names, but the logic inside the loop is a bit convoluted, especially the font handling and the comment explaining the use of insert() instead of add().","tokens":561,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks context.  The \u0027ENUMS\u0027 variable is not defined within the provided scope, making it difficult to assess its purpose and how it influences the returned month.  While the Portuguese comments are helpful, understanding the broader context of the \u0027ENUMS\u0027 variable is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation.","tokens":376,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The comments clearly explain the purpose of the method and the logic used to determine if a year is a leap year. The use of clear variable names and indentation further enhances readability.","tokens":362,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-documented and easy to understand. It clearly explains what it does, defines a constant for PI, and uses descriptive variable names.  It could benefit from using Math.PI instead of defining its own constant.","tokens":343,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"O código é bem organizado e legível, com comentários claros em português. A nomeação de variáveis e métodos é descritiva, facilitando a compreensão. A lógica é simples e fácil de seguir.","tokens":349,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This Java code snippet demonstrates good readability. The comments are in Portuguese, which might be a barrier for non-speakers, but the code itself is clear, concise, and uses descriptive variable names. The logic is easy to follow, making it relatively simple to understand its purpose, which is to combine the state of two DoubleSummaryStatistics objects.","tokens":370,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The comments in Portuguese are clear and helpful, explaining the purpose of the method, parameters, return value, and immutability. The logic is concise, using modulo arithmetic to handle month rollover. The use of a constant ENUMS (presumably an array or enum of months) makes the code more readable. Overall, the code demonstrates good readability and maintainability.","tokens":405,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
