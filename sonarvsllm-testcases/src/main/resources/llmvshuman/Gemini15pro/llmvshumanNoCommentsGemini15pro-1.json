{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context as it doesn\u0027t show the class definition and its purpose. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 should be in English (\u0027subtract\u0027).  The logic uses modulo operator (%) for month calculation which might be confusing and error-prone. No comments are provided for understanding the logic.","tokens":248,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability. The use of ternary operator, while concise, is easily understandable in this context.  Descriptive method names like \u0027getContagem\u0027 and \u0027getSoma\u0027 (presumably Portuguese for \u0027getCount\u0027 and \u0027getSum\u0027) contribute to clarity. The logic is clear: return the average if count is greater than zero, else return 0. The use of \u00270.0d\u0027 clearly indicates a double return type.","tokens":290,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to nested operations and excessive string manipulation. Using int arrays instead of strings would enhance readability. Comments explaining the logic would be beneficial.","tokens":507,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is moderately readable. It uses descriptive variable names (in Portuguese) and has a clear structure. However, understanding the context requires knowledge of  \u0027DynamicTreeNode\u0027, \u0027DadosAmostra\u0027, external data like \u0027NOMES\u0027 and \u0027fontes\u0027, and the purpose of \u0027indiceAleatorio\u0027. ","tokens":481,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context. What is ENUMS? What is ordinal()?  Using magic numbers like (ordinal() / 3) * 3 severely hinders readability. ","tokens":225,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear conditional statement to determine if a year is a leap year. The logic is easy to follow due to its straightforward implementation of the leap year rule.","tokens":270,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is very readable. It uses clear variable names, a constant for PI, and has a descriptive method name. The logic is easy to follow.","tokens":241,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"This code is very readable. It uses clear variable names, a straightforward calculation, and a well-defined function name. The purpose of the code is immediately understandable, even for someone with basic programming knowledge.","tokens":246,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet is highly readable. It clearly combines statistics from another \u0027DoubleSummaryStatistics\u0027 object. The use of meaningful variable names and straightforward operations makes it easy to understand. The \u0027sumWithCompensation\u0027 method hints at handling potential precision errors, which is a good practice.","tokens":299,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks context as it\u0027s only a snippet. The logic heavily relies on implicit knowledge about the \u0027Month\u0027 class (like what \u0027ENUMS\u0027 represents) and its internal representation, making it difficult to understand without further context.","tokens":259,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
