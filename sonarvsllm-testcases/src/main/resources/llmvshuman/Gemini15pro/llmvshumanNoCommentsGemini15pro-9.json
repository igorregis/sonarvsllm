{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context as it\u0027s extracted from a larger class.  The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 suggests subtraction but uses \u0027soma\u0027 (addition). Modulo operation on months suggests date manipulation, demanding further context.  No comments are present to clarify the logic.","tokens":244,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability. The use of ternary operator, while concise, is easily understandable in this context.  Descriptive method names like \u0027getContagem\u0027 and \u0027getSoma\u0027 (presumably Portuguese for \u0027getCount\u0027 and \u0027getSum\u0027) contribute to clarity. The logic is clear: return the average if count is greater than zero, else return 0. The use of \u00270.0d\u0027 clearly indicates a double return type.","tokens":290,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to nested operations and excessive string manipulation. Using int arrays instead of Strings for \u0027numeros\u0027 would enhance readability. Descriptive variable names would further improve comprehension.","tokens":511,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is moderately readable. Using more descriptive variable names would significantly improve clarity. For instance, \u0027geradorNomes\u0027 could be \u0027nameGenerator\u0027 and \u0027stringExibicao\u0027 could be \u0027displayName\u0027.  The logic behind \u0027indiceAleatorio\u0027 and the font selection could benefit from comments explaining their purpose. Overall, while the code functions, its readability could be enhanced with better naming and comments.","tokens":503,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context as the ENUMS array is not defined. Using ordinal for this calculation is not intuitive and can be error-prone. A clearer approach with a switch statement or modulo operator would significantly enhance readability.","tokens":235,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-structured. The use of clear variable names and the straightforward logic make it easy to understand that it determines if a year is a leap year.","tokens":268,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names, a constant for PI, and a straightforward calculation. The purpose of the function is immediately clear.","tokens":241,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is very readable. It uses clear variable names, a straightforward calculation, and a descriptive method name. The purpose is immediately understandable, even for someone unfamiliar with the codebase.","tokens":241,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability. It clearly combines statistics from another DoubleSummaryStatistics object using descriptive variable names and common methods like Math.min/max. The purpose and logic are easy to understand. ","tokens":284,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks context as it depends on an undefined \u0027ENUMS\u0027 array and \u0027ordinal\u0027 method. Assuming standard month enums, the logic is convoluted. Using modulo twice isn\u0027t intuitive.  ","tokens":251,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
