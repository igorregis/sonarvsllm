{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates extremely poor readability. Using non-descriptive, seemingly random Portuguese words for method and variable names makes the purpose and logic completely obscure. Without further context or comments, it\u0027s impossible to understand its function.","tokens":237,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Although concise, the code lacks clarity by using Portuguese vegetable names (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca) for method names, hindering understanding for non-Portuguese speakers. This naming convention severely impacts readability and maintainability, making it difficult to infer the code\u0027s purpose or the relationship between these methods.","tokens":268,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to poorly named variables like \u0027p\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, \u0027dv\u0027 and the logic is convoluted. Using String manipulation for digit handling is inefficient and impacts readability. Comments explaining the purpose and logic would greatly improve understanding.","tokens":516,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses extremely poor variable naming, making it very difficult to understand its purpose. Using meaningful names would significantly improve readability.","tokens":471,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet uses out-of-context, non-descriptive variable names like \u0027tomilho\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 and \u0027ordinal()\u0027. Without further context, it\u0027s impossible to understand the purpose and logic behind these choices, making the code extremely difficult to comprehend.","tokens":250,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code snippet is concise and uses clear boolean logic. However, it lacks a descriptive method name and comments. While experienced programmers will understand the logic (leap year calculation), improving readability would benefit maintainability.","tokens":271,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is very readable. It uses clear variable names (r for radius, a for area) and constants (P for PI). The calculation is straightforward and easy to understand. The use of \u0027final\u0027 for the constant is good practice.","tokens":261,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is very straightforward. It calculates the area of a triangle (presumably). Using clear variable names like \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 for base and height would further enhance readability.","tokens":242,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese words for variable names which harms readability. It lacks context to understand the purpose of the calculations.  While the syntax is correct, the logic is obscured by the naming choices.","tokens":303,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code uses extremely poor naming conventions, making it very difficult to understand its purpose. Using Portuguese words like \u0027nozMoscada\u0027 and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 as identifiers further obfuscates the logic.","tokens":259,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
