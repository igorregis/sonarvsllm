{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates extremely poor readability. Using non-descriptive, seemingly random Portuguese words for method and variable names makes the purpose and logic completely obscure. Without further context or comments, it\u0027s impossible to understand its function.","tokens":237,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Although concise, the code lacks clarity by using Portuguese vegetable names (Brocolis, Espinafre, Jaca) for method names, hindering understanding for non-Portuguese speakers. This naming convention severely impacts readability and maintainability, making it difficult to infer the code\u0027s purpose or the relationship between these methods.","tokens":268,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to poorly named variables like \u0027p\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, \u0027dv\u0027 and the logic is convoluted. Using String manipulation for digit handling is inefficient and impacts readability. Comments explaining the purpose and logic would greatly improve understanding.","tokens":516,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
