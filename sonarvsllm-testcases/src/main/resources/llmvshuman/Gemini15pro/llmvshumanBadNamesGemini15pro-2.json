{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses meaningless and confusing names for variables and methods, making it very hard to understand its purpose. ","tokens":212,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Although syntatically correct, the code lacks context and uses misleading variable names.  Without further context of what \u0027Espinafre\u0027 or \u0027Jaca\u0027 represents, it\u0027s difficult to understand the purpose of this calculation.","tokens":250,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to unclear variable names like \u0027dv\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, \u0027d1\u0027, \u0027d2\u0027.  The logic is convoluted with nested loops and string manipulation instead of simpler arithmetic. It\u0027s difficult to understand what the code aims to achieve.","tokens":524,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses extremely poor variable naming, making it very difficult to understand its purpose. Using meaningful names would significantly improve readability.","tokens":471,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet is very confusing. Using cryptic names like \u0027tomilho\u0027 and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 makes it difficult to understand the purpose. Also, the logic using ordinal and arithmetic operations seems arbitrary without context.","tokens":236,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code snippet is concise and uses clear boolean logic. However, it lacks a clear descriptive name for the function and could benefit from a comment explaining its purpose (e.g., checking for leap years).","tokens":271,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is easily understandable. It calculates the area of a circle. It uses clear variable names and constants. It could be slightly improved by using Math.PI instead of defining P.","tokens":249,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Despite the meaningless variable names, the code is concise, well-formatted, and easy to understand. The calculation is clear and the use of a single return statement enhances readability.","tokens":238,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese words like \u0027gengibre\u0027 (ginger), \u0027batata\u0027 (potato), \u0027salsa\u0027 (parsley), \u0027abobora\u0027 (pumpkin), \u0027tomate\u0027 (tomato), \u0027pepino\u0027 (cucumber), \u0027alecrim\u0027 (rosemary), and \u0027berinjela\u0027 (eggplant) for method and variable names, which harms readability and maintainability for a broader audience. While it might make sense for a localized context, using English is generally recommended for broader understanding and collaboration in software","tokens":367,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code uses meaningless variable names, making it difficult to understand its purpose. Using the modulo operator with an array access adds complexity. Overall, the code is confusing and lacks clarity.","tokens":254,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
