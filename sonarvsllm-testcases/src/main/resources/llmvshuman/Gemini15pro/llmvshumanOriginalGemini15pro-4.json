{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses descriptive names. However, using the method \u0027soma\u0027 (add) to subtract months might be confusing and could be clearer with a dedicated \u0027subtractMonths\u0027 method.","tokens":335,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability. It uses clear naming, concise logic, and helpful Javadoc comments explaining potential issues and suggesting best practices. The use of a ternary operator, while concise, might be slightly less clear for beginners.","tokens":362,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is well-commented in Portuguese, which aids understanding. However, the logic could be simplified. Using String manipulation for arithmetic operations makes it harder to follow. A more straightforward approach with integers would enhance readability.","tokens":943,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code presents some readability issues. While the initial comment is helpful, the variable names lack clarity (e.g., \u0027novoNo\u0027, \u0027indiceAleatorio\u0027). The logic behind \u0027fonte\u0027 assignment and the comment explaining \u0027add()\u0027 vs \u0027insert()\u0027 could be improved for better comprehension.  ","tokens":578,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks context, particularly the static ENUMS array, making it difficult to fully grasp its functionality. While the Javadoc provides a decent explanation, the implementation itself is obscure and relies on magic numbers, hindering readability.","tokens":359,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The comments clearly explain the purpose of the method and the logic used to determine if a year is a leap year. The use of parentheses to separate the conditions enhances readability. ","tokens":361,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. It features clear comments in Portuguese, descriptive variable names, and a straightforward calculation. The use of a constant for PI enhances readability. ","tokens":334,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"O código é bem escrito e fácil de entender. A documentação é clara e concisa, explicando o propósito da função e seus parâmetros. O uso de nomes de variáveis descritivos (base, altura, area) também contribui para a legibilidade. A lógica é simples e direta, tornando o código fácil de seguir. Um ponto de melhoria seria remover o comentário redundante na linha 6, já que a clareza do código torna desnecessário.","tokens":395,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability. The use of clear variable names and a descriptive method name makes it easy to understand the purpose. The comments in Portuguese provide valuable context, especially for Portuguese speakers. The logic is straightforward, enhancing comprehension. ","tokens":349,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and documented. The use of Portuguese in the comments makes it easy to understand for a native speaker. The logic is concise and the use of modulo operator is clever. However, without the context of the \u0027ENUMS\u0027 array, it might be hard to fully grasp the implementation.","tokens":385,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
