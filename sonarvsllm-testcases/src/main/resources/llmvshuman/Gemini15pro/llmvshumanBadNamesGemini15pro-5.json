{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates extremely poor readability. Using non-descriptive, seemingly random Portuguese words for method and variable names makes the purpose and logic completely unclear. Without further context or comments, it\u0027s impossible to understand what this method intends to achieve.","tokens":241,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Although the code is short and uses a ternary operator, the lack of context and the use of Portuguese names for methods (getEspinafre, getJaca) without clear meaning significantly hinder readability. This makes it difficult to understand the purpose and logic of the code.","tokens":259,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to unclear variable names like \u0027dv\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, \u0027d1\u0027, \u0027d2\u0027. While it seems to manipulate a numeric string, the purpose and algorithm are not easily understandable without comments. ","tokens":515,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses extremely poor variable naming, making it very difficult to understand its purpose. Even though the code structure might be correct, the non-descriptive names make it hard to maintain or debug.","tokens":484,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet uses very poor and confusing naming conventions. Without context, \u0027tomilho\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, and \u0027ordinal()\u0027 lack meaning, making the code\u0027s purpose and logic extremely difficult to understand.","tokens":237,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code snippet is concise and generally readable. The logic (leap year calculation) could be better documented with a comment.  The use of \u0027else\u0027 could be avoided by directly returning \u0027false\u0027. Overall, it\u0027s understandable but could benefit from minor improvements.","tokens":283,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is very readable. It uses clear variable names (r for radius, a for area) and constants (P for PI). The calculation is straightforward and easy to understand. The use of \u0027final\u0027 for the constant is good practice.","tokens":261,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very readable. It uses clear variable names (b, a for base and height, r for result) and the calculation is straightforward. The use of a return statement instead of directly returning the calculation makes it even more explicit.  It could benefit from a more descriptive method name and a comment explaining the purpose.","tokens":270,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese words for variable names which harms readability for anyone not familiar with the language. Also, it lacks context as the meaning of \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, etc. is unclear. Using a shared object like \u0027pimenta\u0027 to access unrelated data points (\u0027tomate\u0027, \u0027pepino\u0027, etc.) further reduces understandability.","tokens":333,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses extremely poor variable naming, making it difficult to understand its purpose. Using Portuguese words like \u0027nozMoscada\u0027 and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 further obfuscates the logic. Without context or comments, it\u0027s impossible to decipher.","tokens":268,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
