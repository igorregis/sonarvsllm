{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates extremely poor readability due to the use of meaningless and culturally specific variable names like \u0027paprica\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, and \u0027menta\u0027.  This makes it difficult to understand the purpose and logic of the code without further context or documentation.","tokens":243,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Although syntatically correct, the code lacks context and uses misleading variable names like \"Brocolis\" (broccoli), \"Espinafre\" (spinach), and \"Jaca\" (jackfruit) which are not intuitive and harm readability.","tokens":255,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to unclear variable names like \u0027dv\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, \u0027s\u0027. While it seems to manipulate numeric strings, the purpose is not immediately obvious.  The logic could benefit from comments explaining the algorithm\u0027s steps.","tokens":519,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses extremely poor variable naming, making it very difficult to understand its purpose. Even though the code structure itself is simple, the confusing names make it hard to follow the logic and the intent.","tokens":484,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet uses extremely poor naming conventions like \u0027tomilho\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 and lacks context. Without understanding the broader class structure and purpose, it\u0027s impossible to determine its correctness or intent, making it very difficult to comprehend.","tokens":242,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code lacks comments explaining the logic (leap year?).  The use of magic numbers instead of named constants harms readability. However, the logic itself is straightforward with a simple if/else structure.","tokens":269,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is easily understandable. It calculates the area of a circle. The use of descriptive variable names (r for radius, a for area) and the constant PI makes the code self-explanatory. It could benefit from a more precise value of PI.","tokens":263,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Despite a minor typo (\u0027classh\u0027), the code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names, a simple calculation, and a direct return statement, making its purpose easy to understand.","tokens":240,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese words for variable names like \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027, which hinders understanding for non-Portuguese speakers.  It also lacks context: the purpose of calculations and relationships between variables like \u0027alecrim\u0027 and \u0027berinjela\u0027 are unclear. ","tokens":322,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates extremely poor readability due to the use of meaningless and confusing variable names. Using domain-relevant names would significantly improve clarity and understanding.","tokens":248,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
