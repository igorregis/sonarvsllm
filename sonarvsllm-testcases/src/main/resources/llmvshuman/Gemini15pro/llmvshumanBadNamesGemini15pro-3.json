{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses meaningless and confusing names for variables and methods, making it extremely difficult to understand its purpose or functionality.","tokens":214,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Although the code is short and uses a ternary operator for conciseness, the choice of variable names like \u0027Espinafre\u0027 and \u0027Jaca\u0027 (Portuguese for Spinach and Jackfruit) severely hinders readability for anyone unfamiliar with Portuguese, making it difficult to understand the code\u0027s purpose and logic.","tokens":266,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to cryptic variable names like \u0027dv\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, \u0027s\u0027.  Nested loops and conditional string manipulations within them further hinder readability.  A refactor with meaningful names and extracted helper functions would significantly improve comprehension.","tokens":518,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses extremely poor variable naming, making it very difficult to understand its purpose. Using meaningful names would significantly improve readability.","tokens":469,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet uses meaningless variable and method names like \u0027tomilho\u0027 and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, making it very hard to understand its purpose or functionality without further context.","tokens":227,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code lacks comments explaining the logic (leap year?).  The use of magic numbers reduces readability. However, the formatting is clean, and the conditional statement is clear, making it moderately easy to understand.","tokens":271,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Despite the minor misspelling (\u0027classh\u0027), the code is very concise and easy to understand. The use of descriptive variable names (r for radius, a for area) and constants (P for Pi) makes the logic clear. A slight improvement could be adding a comment explaining the purpose of the function.","tokens":273,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is very straightforward. It calculates the area of a triangle (presumably).  Descriptive variable names would enhance readability further.","tokens":228,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese words for variable names which harms readability. It lacks context on the purpose of calculations and relationships between variables like \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027. ","tokens":301,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses extremely poor variable naming, making it difficult to understand its purpose. Using Portuguese words like \u0027nozMoscada\u0027 and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 further obfuscates the logic. Without context or comments, it\u0027s near impossible to decipher.","tokens":269,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
