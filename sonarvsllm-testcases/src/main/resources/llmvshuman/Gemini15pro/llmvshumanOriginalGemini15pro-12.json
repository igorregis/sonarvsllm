{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-structured, but the variable and method names could be more descriptive. Using \u0027meses\u0027 for both input and calculation might cause confusion.  While \u0027soma\u0027 is called, it\u0027s not defined in the snippet, making it hard to fully grasp the logic without further context.","tokens":355,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and easy to understand. The use of JavaDoc is comprehensive, explaining potential issues with floating-point precision and suggesting input order for better accuracy. The ternary operator, while sometimes discouraged, is used appropriately here for conciseness.","tokens":365,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is well-documented and explains the context clearly. However, the implementation seems unnecessarily complex by using String manipulation instead of simpler integer operations, impacting negatively its readability.","tokens":931,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code presents some readability issues. While it has comments, the logic behind \u0027indiceAleatorio\u0027 and \u0027fonte\u0027 selection is unclear. Variable names are descriptive in Portuguese, which is positive for a localized context, but the magic number and the comment explaining \u0027add()\u0027 vs \u0027insert()\u0027 could be improved with better code structure.","tokens":577,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise and generally readable. However, the use of the \u0027ENUMS\u0027 variable, without further context, makes it difficult to understand what it represents and how it relates to the \u0027Month\u0027 type. Providing more context or renaming the variable would improve clarity.","tokens":373,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The comments clearly explain the purpose of the method and the logic used to determine if a year is a leap year. The use of meaningful variable names and indentation further enhances readability.","tokens":366,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-documented and easy to understand. The use of clear variable names and comments explaining the formula makes it highly readable.  It follows good practices like defining PI as a constant.","tokens":333,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"O código é conciso, bem estruturado e de fácil leitura. A documentação é clara e útil para entender o propósito da função. A nomeação das variáveis é descritiva e segue boas práticas. Um ponto de aprimoramento seria utilizar o tipo \u0027var\u0027 para a variável \u0027area\u0027 a partir do Java 10.","tokens":364,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The use of Portuguese in the comments is suitable for internal documentation and doesn\u0027t hinder comprehension. The logic for combining statistics is clear. ","tokens":342,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-structured. The comments are in Portuguese, which is a plus for a native speaker. The logic is clear, using modulo operation for month rollover. However, the \u0027ENUMS\u0027 variable reference lacks context, potentially hindering full comprehension.","tokens":375,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
