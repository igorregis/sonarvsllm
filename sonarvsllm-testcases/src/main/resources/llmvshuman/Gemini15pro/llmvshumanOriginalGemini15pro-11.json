{"score":"8","reasoning":"Despite the slightly confusing math operation, the code is well-documented and easy to understand. The comments clearly explain the purpose, input, and output.  The use of clear method names like \u0027subtrai\u0027 and \u0027soma\u0027 (Portuguese for subtract and sum) further enhances readability for Portuguese speakers.","tokens":354,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-documented. The use of JavaDoc effectively explains the purpose, behavior, and special considerations. The ternary operator, while compact, maintains readability due to clear context.","tokens":354,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is well-documented and explains the context clearly. However, the logic could be simplified. Using String manipulation and multiple loops impacts readability and could be optimized with numerical operations.","tokens":933,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code presents some issues in terms of readability. Although it has comments, the logic behind \u0027indiceAleatorio\u0027 and the use of \u0027fontes\u0027 is not self-explanatory. Variable names are descriptive in general, but the code could benefit from simplification and clearer logic flow.","tokens":565,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks context. The \u0027ENUMS\u0027 variable is not defined, and its relationship with the \u0027Month\u0027 class is unclear. Without understanding what \u0027ENUMS\u0027 represents, it\u0027s difficult to assess the code\u0027s correctness. The logic itself seems to handle quarter division, but its implementation is obscure.","tokens":380,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The comments are in Portuguese, which might be a slight barrier for non-speakers, but the code itself is clear. The logic for leap year calculation is directly implemented and easily traceable.","tokens":368,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. It features clear comments in Portuguese, descriptive variable names, and a straightforward calculation. Using a named constant for PI enhances readability. ","tokens":330,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"O código é conciso, bem estruturado e de fácil leitura. A documentação é clara e útil para entender o propósito do método. A nomeação das variáveis é descritiva e segue as convenções da linguagem Java. Um ponto de aprimoramento seria utilizar o tipo \u0027var\u0027 para a variável \u0027area\u0027 a partir do Java 10.","tokens":370,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very readable. It uses clear variable names, a descriptive method name, and helpful Javadoc comments in Portuguese. The logic is easy to follow, even for someone unfamiliar with the specific implementation details.","tokens":348,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-documented and easy to understand. The logic is clear, using modulo operator for rollover. However, the use of the \u0027ENUMS\u0027 array without context might require further investigation.","tokens":360,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
