{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context.  The logic is unclear due to the use of Portuguese method names and lack of comments.  The modulo operation on \u0027meses\u0027 suggests a cyclical behavior related to months, but its purpose is not easily understandable without further context.","tokens":238,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability. The use of ternary operator, while concise, is easily understandable in this context.  Descriptive method names like \u0027getContagem\u0027 and \u0027getSoma\u0027 (presumably Portuguese for \u0027getCount\u0027 and \u0027getSum\u0027) contribute to clarity. The logic is clear: return the average if count is greater than zero, else return 0. The use of \u00270.0d\u0027 clearly indicates a double return type.","tokens":290,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to nested operations and excessive string manipulations. Using int arrays instead of strings would improve readability. Comments explaining the logic and algorithm would be beneficial.","tokens":507,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is moderately readable. Using more descriptive variable names like \u0027childNode\u0027 instead of \u0027novoNo\u0027 and \u0027randomIndex\u0027 instead of \u0027indiceAleatorio\u0027 would improve clarity. The logic for setting \u0027fonte\u0027 and \u0027dados\u0027 could be simplified. Overall, it\u0027s understandable but could be more concise.","tokens":486,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context. Using an array called \u0027ENUMS\u0027 and relying on ordinal() makes it cryptic and hard to understand without further context about the \u0027Month\u0027 class.","tokens":227,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear conditional statement to determine if a year is a leap year. The logic is easy to follow due to its straightforward implementation of the leap year rule.","tokens":270,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names, a constant for PI, and a straightforward calculation. The purpose of the function is immediately clear.","tokens":241,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is very readable. It uses clear variable names, a straightforward calculation, and a well-defined function name. The purpose of the code is immediately understandable, even for someone with basic programming knowledge. ","tokens":245,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet is highly readable. It clearly combines statistics from another DoubleSummaryStatistics object.  The use of descriptive variable names and straightforward operations makes it easy to understand its purpose and logic.","tokens":282,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks context as it depends on an undefined \u0027ENUMS\u0027 array and \u0027ordinal\u0027 method. Assuming these relate to a \u0027Month\u0027 enumeration, the logic is hard to follow. Using modulo operator twice adds complexity. A clearer approach with fewer modulo operations or dedicated methods for month addition would improve readability.","tokens":273,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
