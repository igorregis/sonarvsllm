{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context.  The \u0027soma\u0027 method, crucial for understanding the logic, is undefined.  Error: \u0027classh\u0027 instead of \u0027class\u0027.  No comments to clarify the purpose.","tokens":229,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability by using ternary operator for conciseness. It avoids unnecessary verbosity while maintaining clarity. The use of \u0027d\u0027 to specify double literal enhances readability.  ","tokens":238,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to nested operations and excessive string manipulation. Using int arrays instead of strings would improve readability. Comments explaining the logic would be beneficial.","tokens":507,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code snippet demonstrates some effort in readability, employing descriptive variable names like \u0027indiceAleatorio\u0027 and \u0027stringExibicao\u0027. However, the logic behind \u0027fontes\u0027 and its usage could benefit from clearer explanation. The use of magic numbers like \u0027DynamicTreeNode.CONTAGEM_FILHOS_PADRAO\u0027 and hardcoded values like colors could be improved with constants and enums for better maintainability. ","tokens":503,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context. What is ENUMS? What is ordinal()?  Without context, it\u0027s very difficult to understand the purpose and logic. ","tokens":222,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-structured, making it easy to understand. The use of clear variable names and logical operators contributes to its readability. The logic accurately determines leap years based on standard rules. ","tokens":273,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names, a constant for PI, and a straightforward calculation. The purpose of the function is immediately clear.","tokens":241,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very straightforward. Method name clearly indicates its purpose, variable names are adequate, and the calculation is easy to follow.  ","tokens":231,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability. It clearly combines statistics from another DoubleSummaryStatistics object. The use of self-explanatory method names like \u0027sumWithCompensation\u0027 and clear arithmetic operations makes the logic easy to follow.","tokens":287,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks context as the \u0027ENUMS\u0027 array and \u0027ordinal\u0027 method are not defined within the snippet. Assuming they refer to a standard enumeration of months, the logic is somewhat convoluted. Using modulo operator twice isn\u0027t immediately clear and could benefit from a comment explaining its purpose.","tokens":269,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
