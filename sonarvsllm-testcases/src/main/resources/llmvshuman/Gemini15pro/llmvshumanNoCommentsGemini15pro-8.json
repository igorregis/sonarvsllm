{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context as it doesn\u0027t show the class definition and its purpose. The method names \u0027subtrai\u0027 and \u0027soma\u0027 should be in English to follow Java conventions.  No comments are present to explain the logic behind the modulo operation or the overall functionality.","tokens":244,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability. The use of ternary operator, while concise, is appropriate here and doesn\u0027t hinder understanding. Method names are in Portuguese, which is acceptable considering the evaluator\u0027s language proficiency.  ","tokens":244,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to nested operations and excessive string manipulation. Using int arrays would improve readability. Comments explaining the logic and purpose would be beneficial.","tokens":506,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code snippet demonstrates some effort in readability with meaningful variable names like \u0027fonte\u0027 and \u0027indiceAleatorio\u0027. However, the logic behind \u0027fontes\u0027 and its usage could benefit from a clarifying comment. The use of magic numbers like \u0027DynamicTreeNode.CONTAGEM_FILHOS_PADRAO\u0027 and hardcoded values like colors could be improved. Overall, it\u0027s understandable but could be more self-explanatory.","tokens":506,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context. What is ENUMS? What does ordinal() refer to?  Magic numbers like 3 decrease readability.  It seems to calculate the first month of a quarter, but it\u0027s not immediately clear.","tokens":238,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear conditional statement to determine if a year is a leap year. The logic is easy to follow due to its straightforward implementation of the leap year rule.","tokens":270,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names, a constant for PI, and a straightforward calculation. The purpose of the method is immediately clear.","tokens":241,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is very readable. It uses clear variable names, a straightforward calculation, and a descriptive method name. The purpose is immediately understandable, even for someone unfamiliar with the codebase.","tokens":241,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet is highly readable. It clearly combines statistics from another DoubleSummaryStatistics object using descriptive variable names and standard Java methods. The purpose and logic are immediately understandable.","tokens":278,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks context as it\u0027s only a snippet. Using modulo (%) for month arithmetic is understandable but can be error-prone. The \u0027ENUMS\u0027 variable is not defined, making it difficult to assess its purpose and correctness. ","tokens":258,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
