{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context as it doesn\u0027t show the class definition. The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 should be in English for consistency.  The logic uses modulo operator for month subtraction, which might be confusing and error-prone. No comments are provided to explain the logic.","tokens":245,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability. The use of ternary operator, while can be confusing for beginners, is concise and commonly used in Java. Method names are descriptive in Portuguese, which is understandable considering the context. ","tokens":242,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to nested operations and excessive string manipulation. Using int arrays instead of strings would improve readability. Comments explaining the logic and purpose would be beneficial.","tokens":509,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is moderately readable. It uses descriptive variable names like \u0027indiceAleatorio\u0027 and \u0027stringExibicao\u0027. However, the logic behind \u0027fontes\u0027 and \u0027canDisplayUpTo\u0027 needs more context. The use of magic numbers like \u0027CONTAGEM_FILHOS_PADRAO\u0027 and hardcoded colors could be improved with constants and enums, respectively.","tokens":496,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context. Using an array called \u0027ENUMS\u0027 without context makes it difficult to understand its purpose and content. The logic, while potentially valid, is not immediately clear due to the lack of comments or descriptive variable names.","tokens":239,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code snippet is easily understandable. It uses a clear and concise way to determine if a year is a leap year, following the standard rules. The logic is well-structured and easy to follow.","tokens":273,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. It clearly calculates the area of a circle. The use of \u0027final\u0027 for PI is a good practice. A minor improvement could be directly returning the calculated value instead of storing it in \u0027area\u0027 variable.","tokens":263,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"10","reasoning":"This code is very readable. It uses clear variable names, a straightforward calculation, and a well-formatted structure. The purpose of the function is immediately clear.","tokens":237,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability. It clearly combines statistics from another \u0027DoubleSummaryStatistics\u0027 object using descriptive variable names and common methods like Math.min/max. The purpose and logic are easy to understand.","tokens":286,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks context as it\u0027s extracted from a larger class definition. It seems to handle month arithmetic but the \u0027ENUMS\u0027 array and its purpose are unclear. The logic itself is compressed and could benefit from comments explaining the modulo operations and array access.","tokens":263,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
