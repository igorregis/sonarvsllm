{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context. What is \u0027Month\u0027? Is it an enum or a custom class?  The logic is unclear due to the absence of context. Why modulo 12?  The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 should be \u0027subtract\u0027 for consistency.  No comments to explain the logic.","tokens":250,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability. The use of ternary operator, while can be confusing for beginners, is concise and commonly used by Java developers. Method names are in Portuguese, which is understandable considering my background. ","tokens":242,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to nested operations and string manipulation for arithmetic. Using int arrays would be more suitable. Comments explaining the logic and purpose would greatly enhance readability.","tokens":509,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code snippet demonstrates some level of organization but lacks clarity due to unclear variable names and the absence of context. While the logic of creating and inserting child nodes is understandable, the purpose and origin of variables like \u0027NOMES,\u0027 \u0027fontes,\u0027 and \u0027contagemNomes\u0027 remain unclear without further context. The use of magic numbers like \u0027DynamicTreeNode.CONTAGEM_FILHOS_PADRAO\u0027 and the random color assignment could benefit from better naming and documentation.","tokens":516,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context. Using an array called ENUMS with ordinal manipulation is cryptic and provides poor readability. Without context on what ENUMS represents and how it\u0027s structured, the logic is unclear.","tokens":232,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses meaningful variable names. The logic for leap year calculation is clear, making it easy to understand. It could benefit from removing the else block for a slightly cleaner look.","tokens":272,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names like \u0027raio\u0027 (radius) and \u0027area\u0027, a constant for PI, and has a descriptive method name \u0027calcularAreaCirculo\u0027 (calculate circle area). The logic is straightforward, making it easy to understand.","tokens":266,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is very readable. It uses clear variable names, a straightforward calculation, and a descriptive method name. The purpose is immediately understandable, even for someone unfamiliar with the specific math formula.","tokens":242,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability. It clearly combines statistics from another DoubleSummaryStatistics object using descriptive variable names and common methods like Math.min/max. The purpose and logic are easy to follow.","tokens":284,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks context as it\u0027s only a snippet. Using modulo (%) for month arithmetic is understandable but can be error-prone. The \u0027ENUMS\u0027 variable is not defined, making it difficult to assess its purpose and correctness. ","tokens":258,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
