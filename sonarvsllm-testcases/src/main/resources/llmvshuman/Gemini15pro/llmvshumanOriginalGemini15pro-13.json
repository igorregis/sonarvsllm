{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-documented, making it relatively easy to understand. However, using a method named \u0027soma\u0027 (addition) to perform subtraction might be confusing and could benefit from a more descriptive name like \u0027adicionaMeses\u0027 (addMonths) for better clarity.","tokens":351,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. The use of ternary operator enhances readability for the average calculation. Javadoc effectively explains the method\u0027s purpose, potential numerical variations, and provides a helpful tip for accuracy.","tokens":356,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code has good documentation explaining the context. However, the logic could be simplified. Using String manipulation for arithmetic operations makes it harder to read.  It impacts negatively the performance.","tokens":931,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code presents some issues in terms of readability. Although it has comments, the logic inside the \u0027for\u0027 loop is a bit convoluted, mixing different concerns like random name generation, font selection and color assignment. ","tokens":551,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks context. The \u0027ENUMS\u0027 variable is not defined, and its relationship with the \u0027Month\u0027 class is unclear. Without understanding what \u0027ENUMS\u0027 represents, it\u0027s difficult to assess the code\u0027s correctness. The logic itself seems to handle quarter division, but the magic number \u00273\u0027 and lack of clarity about \u0027ordinal()\u0027 hinder readability.","tokens":395,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The comments clearly explain the purpose of the method and the logic used to determine if a year is a leap year. The use of meaningful variable names and indentation further enhances readability.","tokens":366,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-documented and easy to understand. The use of clear variable names and comments explaining the formula makes it highly readable.  It follows good practices like defining PI as a constant.","tokens":333,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"O código é conciso, bem estruturado e de fácil leitura. A documentação é clara e descreve o propósito da função, os parâmetros e o valor de retorno. A nomeação das variáveis é intuitiva e segue as convenções da linguagem Java. A lógica de cálculo da área do triângulo isósceles é implementada de forma direta e eficiente.","tokens":372,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The use of clear variable names and comments in Portuguese contribute to its readability. The logic for combining statistics is straightforward. ","tokens":338,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and documented. The use of Portuguese in the comments is appropriate given the context. The logic, however, could be clearer for the modulo operation, especially handling negative months.","tokens":360,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
