{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context as it doesn\u0027t show the class definition and its purpose. The logic for subtraction using modulo (%) might be accurate but is not immediately clear.  The method and variable names are in Portuguese which might be acceptable depending on the project\u0027s context but hurts readability for a wider audience.  No comments are provided to explain the logic.","tokens":259,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability. The use of ternary operator, while concise, is easily understandable in this context.  Descriptive method names like \u0027getContagem\u0027 and \u0027getSoma\u0027 (presumably Portuguese for \u0027getCount\u0027 and \u0027getSum\u0027) contribute to clarity. The logic is clear: return the average if count is greater than zero, else return 0. The use of \u00270.0d\u0027 clearly indicates a double return type.","tokens":290,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to nested operations and string manipulation for arithmetic. Using int arrays instead of Strings would enhance readability. Comments explaining the logic and purpose of the function are missing.","tokens":512,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code snippet demonstrates some effort in readability with meaningful variable names like \u0027fonte\u0027 and \u0027indiceAleatorio\u0027. However, the logic behind \u0027fontes\u0027 and its usage to determine \u0027fonte\u0027 could be clearer. The use of magic numbers like \u0027DynamicTreeNode.CONTAGEM_FILHOS_PADRAO\u0027 and hardcoded values like colors could be improved with constants and enums for better maintainability.","tokens":502,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses magic numbers and assumes a structure of ENUMS without context. Using modulo operation for this purpose is not intuitive. ","tokens":217,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear conditional statement to determine if a year is a leap year. The logic is easy to follow due to its straightforward implementation of the leap year rule.","tokens":270,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names like \u0027raio\u0027 (radius) and \u0027area\u0027, a constant for PI, and has a descriptive method name \u0027calcularAreaCirculo\u0027 (calculate circle area). The logic is straightforward, making it easy to understand.","tokens":266,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is very readable. It uses clear variable names, a straightforward calculation, and a descriptive method name. The purpose is immediately understandable, even for someone unfamiliar with the codebase.","tokens":241,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability. It clearly combines statistics from another DoubleSummaryStatistics object using descriptive variable names and common methods like Math.min/max. The purpose and logic are easy to understand.","tokens":284,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks context as the \u0027ENUMS\u0027 array and \u0027ordinal()\u0027 method are not defined within the snippet. Assuming they refer to a standard enum representation of months, the logic is somewhat convoluted. Using modulo operator twice isn\u0027t immediately clear and could benefit from simplification or comments.","tokens":269,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
