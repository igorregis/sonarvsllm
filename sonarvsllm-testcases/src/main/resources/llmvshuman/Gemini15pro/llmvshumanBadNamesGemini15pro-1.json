{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates extremely poor readability due to the use of meaningless and culturally specific variable names like \u0027paprica\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, and \u0027menta\u0027.  This lack of semantic clarity makes it difficult to understand the purpose and logic of the code.","tokens":242,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Although syntactically correct, the code lacks clarity due to poor naming choices. Using domain-specific names instead of \u0027Brocolis\u0027, \u0027Espinafre\u0027, and \u0027Jaca\u0027 would significantly enhance readability and understanding.","tokens":250,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to unclear variable names like \u0027dv\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, \u0027s\u0027. While it seems to process a string digit by digit, the purpose and logic behind the calculations are not easily understandable without comments.","tokens":515,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses extremely poor variable naming, making it very difficult to understand its purpose. Using meaningful names would significantly improve readability.","tokens":471,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet is very confusing. Using cryptic names like \u0027tomilho\u0027 (thyme), \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 (cayenne pepper), and unclear calculations severely hinders readability. Without context or comments, understanding its purpose is nearly impossible.","tokens":241,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code snippet is concise and generally readable. The logic (leap year calculation) could be better documented with a comment.  The use of \u0027else\u0027 could be avoided by directly returning false.  ","tokens":270,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is very readable. It uses clear variable names (r for radius, a for area) and constants (P for PI). The calculation is straightforward and easy to understand. The use of \u0027final\u0027 for the constant is good practice.","tokens":261,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and easy to understand. It clearly calculates the product of two doubles \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027, divides the result by 2, and returns the final value. The use of meaningful variable names (\u0027b\u0027, \u0027a\u0027, \u0027r\u0027 for result) further enhances readability.  A minor improvement could be using a more descriptive variable name than \u0027r\u0027, such as \u0027result\u0027 or \u0027area\u0027 depending on the context.","tokens":294,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese words for variable names like \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027, which harms readability for non-speakers. While the logic is simple arithmetic and min/max operations, the lack of context for these variables and the \u0027pimenta\u0027 object makes it hard to understand the code\u0027s purpose.","tokens":330,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code uses meaningless and confusing variable names, making it extremely difficult to understand its purpose or logic. ","tokens":238,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
