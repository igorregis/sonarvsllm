{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-documented, making it relatively easy to understand. However, using a method named \u0027soma\u0027 (addition) to perform subtraction might be confusing and could benefit from a more descriptive name like \u0027adicionaMeses\u0027 or similar.","tokens":349,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-structured. The use of JavaDoc is helpful, and the ternary operator, while compact, is appropriate here.  The logic is clear: if there\u0027s a count, calculate the average, otherwise return 0. ","tokens":369,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is well-commented in Portuguese, which aids understanding. However, using Strings to handle numeric operations makes it less readable. Refactoring to use int array would improve clarity.","tokens":936,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code presents some level of readability with comments explaining its purpose. However, using variables like \u0027indiceAleatorio\u0027 and magic numbers like \u0027CONTAGEM_FILHOS_PADRAO\u0027 without clear context slightly hinders understanding. The comment explaining the avoidance of \u0027add()\u0027 method is verbose and could be refactored for better clarity.","tokens":587,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks context. The \u0027ENUMS\u0027 array is not defined, making it difficult to understand what the code does. While the Javadoc explains the functionality, the implementation is obscure and relies on magic numbers, hindering readability.","tokens":361,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-written and easy to understand. It features clear comments, descriptive variable names (in Portuguese), and a straightforward implementation of the leap year logic. The use of modulo operator simplifies the divisibility checks.","tokens":360,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. It uses clear variable names, comments in Portuguese, and follows a logical flow. The calculation is straightforward and well-explained. This code demonstrates good readability and maintainability.","tokens":342,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"O código é bem escrito e fácil de entender. A documentação é clara e concisa, explicando o propósito da classe e do método. A nomeação das variáveis é descritiva e o uso da fórmula para calcular a área do triângulo é de fácil compreensão. A indentação e o espaçamento consistentes também contribuem para a legibilidade geral.","tokens":384,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet is well-documented and easy to understand. The use of Portuguese in the comments enhances readability for Portuguese speakers. The logic is clear, combining statistics from another DoubleSummaryStatistics object.  ","tokens":342,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and documented. The use of Portuguese in the comments makes it easy to understand for a native speaker. The logic is concise, using modulo operator effectively. However, without context about \u0027ENUMS\u0027 it might require additional investigation.","tokens":374,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
