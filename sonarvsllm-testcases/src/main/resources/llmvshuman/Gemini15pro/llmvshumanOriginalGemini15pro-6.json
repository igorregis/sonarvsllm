{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-documented, making it relatively easy to understand. However, using a method named \u0027soma\u0027 (addition) to perform subtraction might be confusing and could benefit from a more descriptive name like \u0027adicionaMeses\u0027 (addMonths) for better clarity.","tokens":354,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and employs clear naming conventions. The Javadoc effectively explains the function\u0027s purpose, potential rounding behavior, and optimization hints. ","tokens":345,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is well-commented in Portuguese, which aids understanding. However, the logic could be simplified. Using String manipulation for arithmetic operations makes it harder to follow than directly using integer operations.","tokens":936,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code uses descriptive variable names (in Portuguese) and has comments to explain its logic. However, the comment explaining the unusual use of \u0027insert()\u0027 instead of \u0027add()\u0027 could be clearer and directly in the \u0027add()\u0027 method documentation.","tokens":568,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks context, particularly the static ENUMS member, making it difficult to fully grasp its functionality. While the Javadoc provides a decent explanation, the implementation itself is obscure and relies on magic numbers, hindering readability.","tokens":359,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. It features clear comments, descriptive variable names (in Portuguese), and a straightforward implementation of the leap year logic. The use of modulo operator simplifies the divisibility checks.","tokens":360,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-documented and easy to understand. The use of clear variable names and comments explaining the formula makes it highly readable.  It follows good practices like defining PI as a constant.","tokens":336,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"O código é bem escrito e fácil de entender. A documentação é clara e concisa, explicando o propósito da função e seus parâmetros. O uso de nomes de variáveis descritivos (base, altura, area) também contribui para a legibilidade. A lógica é simples e direta, tornando o código fácil de seguir. Um ponto de melhoria seria remover o comentário redundante na linha 6, já que a própria linha de código já é autoexplicativa.","tokens":395,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The use of clear variable names and comments in Portuguese makes it easy for a Portuguese speaker to comprehend. The logic of combining statistics is straightforward. ","tokens":341,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and documented. The comments clearly explain the purpose, inputs, outputs, and behavior. The use of modulo operator for rollover is efficient. However, the meaning of \u0027ENUMS\u0027 is unclear without further context.","tokens":371,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
