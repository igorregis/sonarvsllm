{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context as it\u0027s just a single method.  The method name \u0027subtrai\u0027 suggests subtraction but uses \u0027soma\u0027 (addition) internally, creating confusion.  Modulus operation before negation adds complexity without clarity. No comments are present to explain the logic. ","tokens":245,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"This code, while concise, demonstrates good readability. The use of ternary operator, while can be confusing for beginners, is well-placed here and improves conciseness.  Descriptive method names like \u0027getContagem\u0027 and \u0027getSoma\u0027 (presumably Portuguese for \u0027count\u0027 and \u0027sum\u0027) contribute to understanding the logic.  The use of \u00270.0d\u0027 clearly indicates a double return type.","tokens":283,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to nested operations and string manipulation for arithmetic. Variable names like \u0027n\u0027 aren\u0027t descriptive. It\u0027s functional but could be more readable with simpler logic and better naming conventions.","tokens":518,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is moderately readable. It uses descriptive variable names (in Portuguese) and has a clear structure. However, understanding the context requires knowledge of external variables like \u0027NOMES,\u0027 \u0027fontes,\u0027 and \u0027geradorNomes,\u0027 and the purpose of \u0027DadosAmostra\u0027 and \u0027DynamicTreeNode\u0027 classes.","tokens":484,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context. What is ENUMS? What is ordinal()?  Without context, it\u0027s hard to understand the purpose and logic. Use of magic number \u00273\u0027 further hinders readability.","tokens":232,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear variable names. The logic, determining leap year, is implemented directly and understandably. It could benefit from removing the else block for a slight readability improvement.","tokens":270,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names like \u0027raio\u0027 (radius) and \u0027area\u0027, a constant for PI, and has a descriptive method name \u0027calcularAreaCirculo\u0027 (calculate circle area). The logic is straightforward, making it easy to understand.","tokens":266,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very straightforward. Method name clearly indicates its purpose, variable names are adequate, and the calculation is easy to follow.  ","tokens":231,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability. It clearly combines statistics from another \u0027DoubleSummaryStatistics\u0027 object using descriptive variable names and common methods like Math.min/max. The purpose and logic are easy to understand.","tokens":286,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks context as the \u0027ENUMS\u0027 array and \u0027ordinal\u0027 method are not defined within the snippet. Assuming they refer to standard enum functionalities, the logic (modulus usage for month rollover) is sound but could benefit from comments explaining the purpose and logic.","tokens":265,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
