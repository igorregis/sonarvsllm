{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet uses meaningless and confusing names for variables and methods. Without context or comments, it\u0027s impossible to understand its purpose or functionality.","tokens":220,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Although syntactically correct, the code lacks context. Using domain-specific terms like \u0027getEspinafre\u0027 (Portuguese for Spinach) and \u0027getJaca\u0027 (Portuguese for Jackfruit) without clear context or comments severely hinders readability and understandability.","tokens":257,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to unclear variable names like \u0027dv\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, \u0027d1\u0027, \u0027d2\u0027. While it seems to manipulate a numeric string, the purpose and algorithm are not easily understandable without comments. ","tokens":515,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses extremely poor variable naming, making it very hard to understand its purpose. While it seems to follow a coherent structure, the lack of context and the confusing names make it difficult to assess its correctness and maintainability.","tokens":491,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable names like \u0027tomilho\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 and lacks context. Without understanding the purpose of \u0027ordinal()\u0027 and the content of \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, the logic is impossible to decipher.","tokens":242,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code snippet is concise and uses clear variable names. The logic (leap year calculation) could be better documented with a comment.  The \u0027else\u0027 block could be simplified to a single \u0027return false\u0027 statement.","tokens":274,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is very readable. It uses clear variable names (r for radius, a for area) and constants (P for PI). The calculation is straightforward and easy to understand. The use of \u0027final\u0027 for the constant is good practice.","tokens":261,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"Despite the meaningless variable names, the code is concise, well-formatted, and easy to understand. Using a more descriptive variable name for \u0027r\u0027 (e.g., \u0027result\u0027 or \u0027area\u0027) would further enhance readability.","tokens":250,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese words for variable names like \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027, which harms readability for non-Portuguese speakers.  It also lacks context on the purpose of calculations and the meaning of variables like \u0027alecrim\u0027, \u0027berinjela\u0027. Using \u0027pimenta\u0027 (pepper) as an instance of DoubleSummaryStatistics is confusing.","tokens":337,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses meaningless and confusing variable names, making it extremely difficult to understand its purpose. Using Portuguese words like \u0027nozMoscada\u0027 and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 further obfuscates the logic and lacks context.","tokens":261,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
