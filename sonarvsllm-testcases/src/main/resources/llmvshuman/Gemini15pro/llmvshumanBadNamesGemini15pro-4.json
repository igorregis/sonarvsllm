{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable names like \u0027paprica\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, and \u0027menta\u0027, making it very difficult to understand its purpose or logic without further context.","tokens":228,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Although syntatically correct, the code lacks clarity due to poor naming choices. Using domain-specific names like \u0027getSpinach\u0027, \u0027getJackfruit\u0027, and \u0027getBroccoli\u0027 would significantly enhance readability and understanding.","tokens":247,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to unclear variable names like \u0027dv\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, \u0027d1\u0027, \u0027d2\u0027.  The logic is convoluted with nested loops and conditional string manipulations.  Descriptive variable names and comments explaining the algorithm\u0027s purpose would significantly improve readability.","tokens":525,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses extremely poor variable naming, making it very difficult to understand its purpose. Using meaningful names would significantly improve readability.","tokens":471,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet is very confusing. Using cryptic names like \u0027tomilho\u0027 and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 makes it extremely difficult to understand the purpose.  The logic involving ordinal division and multiplication without context adds to the obscurity. ","tokens":238,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is fairly readable. The logic (leap year calculation) could be clearer, perhaps with a comment or extracted to a descriptively named method.  Avoiding the \u0027else\u0027 and directly returning \u0027false\u0027 would improve conciseness.","tokens":278,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"O código é bastante legível. Utiliza nomes de variáveis descritivos (r para raio, a para área), define a constante PI e a lógica é simples de seguir. Poderia melhorar ao usar Math.PI ao invés de definir a constante P.","tokens":264,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is very straightforward. It calculates the area of a triangle (presumably). Using clear variable names like \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027 for base and height would further enhance readability.","tokens":242,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese words like \u0027gengibre\u0027, \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027 for method and variable names, which harms readability for non-Portuguese speakers. While it might be familiar to the original developer, it doesn\u0027t follow common Java naming conventions, hindering maintainability and understanding for a wider audience.","tokens":326,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code uses extremely poor naming conventions, making it very difficult to understand its purpose. Using Portuguese words like \u0027nozMoscada\u0027 and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 further obfuscates the logic and hints at localization issues.","tokens":262,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
