{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-documented, making it relatively easy to understand. However, using a method named \u0027soma\u0027 (addition) to perform subtraction might be confusing and could benefit from a more descriptive name like \u0027adicionaMeses\u0027 (addMonths) for better clarity.","tokens":354,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and employs clear naming conventions. The Javadoc effectively explains the function\u0027s purpose, potential rounding behavior, and optimization hints. ","tokens":345,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is well-commented in Portuguese, which aids understanding. However, the logic could be simplified. Using String manipulation for arithmetic operations makes it less intuitive.  A more object-oriented approach could enhance readability.","tokens":941,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is fairly readable with some context. The comments are helpful, but variable names like \u0027novoNo\u0027 and \u0027indiceAleatorio\u0027 could be more descriptive. The logic inside the loop is a bit convoluted, especially the font handling. Overall, it\u0027s understandable but could benefit from some refactoring.","tokens":581,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks context, particularly the static ENUMS array, making it difficult to fully grasp its functionality. While the Javadoc explains the purpose, understanding the implementation requires additional information.","tokens":351,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet is well-written and easy to understand. It features clear comments in Portuguese, a descriptive method name, and a straightforward implementation of the leap year logic. The use of inline comments further enhances readability.","tokens":359,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is very readable. It uses clear variable names in Portuguese, includes useful comments explaining the logic, and has a well-defined structure. The use of a constant for PI is a good practice.","tokens":338,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"O código é bem escrito e fácil de entender. A documentação é clara e concisa, explicando o propósito da função e seus parâmetros. O uso de nomes de variáveis descritivos (base, altura, area) também contribui para a legibilidade. A lógica é simples e direta, tornando o código fácil de seguir. Um ponto de melhoria seria remover o comentário redundante na linha 6, já que a clareza do código torna-o autoexplicativo.","tokens":396,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The use of clear variable names and comments in Portuguese makes it easy for a native speaker to comprehend. The logic is straightforward, combining statistics from another DoubleSummaryStatistics object.","tokens":347,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and well-structured. The comments are in Portuguese, which is beneficial for a native speaker. However, the logic behind the calculation could be clearer, especially the use of (amount + 12).","tokens":368,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
