{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates extremely poor readability. Using non-descriptive, seemingly random names like \u0027paprica\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027, and \u0027menta\u0027 makes the code\u0027s purpose and logic completely obscure. ","tokens":233,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses non-descriptive variable names like \"Espinafre\" (Portuguese for spinach) and \"Jaca\" (jackfruit). This severely hinders understanding for anyone not familiar with Portuguese, even with Java knowledge. The ternary operator, while compact, adds complexity. ","tokens":260,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to cryptic variable names like \u0027dv\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, \u0027s\u0027.  Nested loops and conditional string manipulation without comments make it hard to decipher the code\u0027s intent.  Refactoring with meaningful names and comments would significantly improve readability.","tokens":523,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses extremely poor variable naming, making it very difficult to understand its purpose. Using meaningful names would significantly improve readability.","tokens":471,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet is very confusing. Using cryptic names like \u0027tomilho\u0027 (thyme) and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 (cayenne pepper) without context makes understanding the purpose extremely difficult. Additionally, directly manipulating ordinals without clear intent raises concerns about maintainability and logic.","tokens":249,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code lacks comments explaining its somewhat unclear purpose - determining if \u0027a\u0027 represents a leap year. Logic is correct but could be clearer by directly using leap year rules without modulo arithmetic.","tokens":267,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is easily understandable. It calculates the area of a circle. Using a more descriptive variable name for \u0027a\u0027 (e.g., \u0027area\u0027) would further enhance readability.","tokens":249,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very straightforward. It clearly calculates the product of two doubles \u0027b\u0027 and \u0027a\u0027, divides the result by 2, and returns the final value. The variable names could be more descriptive, but the overall simplicity makes it easy to understand.","tokens":257,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese words for variable names which harms readability, it is not clear what the variables represent.  It also lacks context - what is \u0027abobora\u0027?  Why is \u0027pepino\u0027 negated?  More context and better naming would improve the score.","tokens":319,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet uses extremely poor naming conventions, making it very difficult to understand its purpose. Using meaningful names for variables and methods would significantly improve readability.","tokens":248,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
