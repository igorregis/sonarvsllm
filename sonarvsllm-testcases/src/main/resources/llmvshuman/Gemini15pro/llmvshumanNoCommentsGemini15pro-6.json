{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context. What is the \u0027Month\u0027 class?  The logic is unclear due to the lack of comments. Why modulo 12? Method and variable names are in Portuguese, impacting readability for non-Portuguese speakers. ","tokens":235,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability. The use of ternary operator, while can be confusing for beginners, is concise and commonly used in Java. Method names are descriptive in Portuguese, which is understandable considering the context. ","tokens":242,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to nested operations and string manipulation for arithmetic. Using int arrays would be more efficient and readable. Comments explaining the logic would significantly improve understandability.","tokens":510,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code snippet demonstrates some structure but lacks clarity in variable names and intent. Using magic numbers like \u0027DynamicTreeNode.CONTAGEM_FILHOS_PADRAO\u0027 and unexplained structures like \u0027NOMES\u0027 and \u0027fontes\u0027 hinders understanding. The logic behind color assignment and the purpose of \u0027DadosAmostra\u0027 are not immediately obvious.","tokens":489,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code lacks context. What is ENUMS? What is ordinal()?  Using magic numbers like (ordinal() / 3) * 3 severely hinders readability. ","tokens":225,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses clear, descriptive variable names. The logic for leap year calculation is implemented correctly. It could benefit from removing the else block for slight improvement.","tokens":267,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is highly readable. It uses clear variable names, a constant for PI, and a straightforward calculation. The purpose of the function is immediately clear.","tokens":241,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is very readable. It uses clear variable names, a straightforward calculation, and a well-defined function name. The purpose of the code is immediately understandable, even for someone with basic programming knowledge.","tokens":245,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates good readability. It clearly combines statistics from another DoubleSummaryStatistics object. The use of descriptive method names like \u0027sumWithCompensation\u0027 makes the logic easy to follow. ","tokens":281,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code lacks context as it\u0027s unclear what the \u0027Month\u0027 type represents. Using modulo (%) for month arithmetic is understandable but can be error-prone. The \u0027ENUMS\u0027 variable reference is not explained and might be confusing without further context. ","tokens":261,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
