{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet demonstrates very poor readability. Using non-descriptive, single-letter variable names like \u0027l\u0027 and \u0027m\u0027 makes the code difficult to understand. Additionally, the purpose of the calculation `-(l % 12)` is unclear without context, hindering comprehensibility.","tokens":249,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"Although syntatically correct, the code lacks context and uses misleading variable names like \"Brocolis\" (broccoli), \"Espinafre\" (spinach), and \"Jaca\" (jackfruit) which seem unrelated, making it difficult to understand the purpose and logic.","tokens":261,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code lacks clarity due to unclear variable names like \u0027dv\u0027, \u0027p\u0027, \u0027d\u0027, \u0027s\u0027. While it seems to process digits within a string, the logic is convoluted by nested operations and string manipulations. A refactor with meaningful names and extracted helper functions would significantly improve readability.","tokens":525,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses extremely poor variable naming, making it very difficult to understand its purpose. Using meaningful names would significantly improve readability.","tokens":471,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"This code snippet uses very poor naming choices for methods and variables, making it extremely difficult to understand its purpose or functionality without further context.","tokens":218,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code snippet is concise and implements a clear logic for leap year verification. However, it lacks comments explaining the logic and the purpose of the \u0027a\u0027 parameter, which could be improved by renaming it to \u0027year\u0027 for better context.","tokens":278,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very concise and easy to understand. The use of descriptive variable names (r for radius, a for area) and the constant PI makes it clear what the code is calculating. The only minor improvement could be adding a comment explaining that the function calculates the area of a circle.","tokens":272,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"This code is very straightforward. It clearly calculates the product of two doubles (b and a) and then divides the result by 2, returning the final double value. The variable names could be more descriptive, but the logic is clear.","tokens":251,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses Portuguese words for variable names like \u0027batata\u0027, \u0027salsa\u0027, \u0027abobora\u0027, which hinders understanding for non-Portuguese speakers.  While it compiles, using DoubleSummaryStatistics for seemingly unrelated data like \u0027tomate\u0027, \u0027pepino\u0027, \u0027alecrim\u0027 is confusing and suggests a lack of clear data structure.","tokens":331,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"1","reasoning":"The code uses extremely poor variable naming, making it difficult to understand its purpose. Using Portuguese words like \u0027nozMoscada\u0027 and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027 further obfuscates the logic. Without context or comments, it\u0027s almost impossible to decipher.","tokens":269,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
