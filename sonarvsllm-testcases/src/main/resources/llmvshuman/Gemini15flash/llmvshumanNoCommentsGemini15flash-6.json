{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and easy to understand. The method subtracts a given number of months from the current month, using modulo operation to handle year boundaries. The code is well-formatted and uses clear variable names.","tokens":238,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise and readable. It uses a ternary operator to efficiently calculate the average, making it easy to understand. The variable names are clear and descriptive, further enhancing readability.","tokens":241,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"5","reasoning":"The code is functional but hard to read. It uses nested loops and complex string manipulations, making it difficult to understand the logic at a glance. The variable names are not very descriptive, and the code lacks comments, further hindering comprehension.","tokens":523,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses clear variable names. The logic is understandable, but the use of magic numbers like \u0027CONTAGEM_FILHOS_PADRAO\u0027 and \u00272\u0027 could be improved with constants. The conditional font handling adds complexity, but it\u0027s well-explained.","tokens":481,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a clear naming convention. The logic is straightforward, but it might benefit from a comment explaining the calculation of the first month of the trimester. Overall, it\u0027s easy to understand.","tokens":242,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The function name is clear and descriptive, and the logic for determining leap years is implemented correctly and efficiently. The use of parentheses for clarity is a good practice.","tokens":281,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, uses clear variable names, and follows standard Java conventions. The use of a constant for PI enhances readability. The logic is straightforward and easy to understand.","tokens":252,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very readable and easy to understand. It uses clear variable names and a simple formula to calculate the area of an isosceles triangle. The code is well-formatted and follows standard Java conventions.","tokens":250,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. It combines data from another DoubleSummaryStatistics object using clear and concise operations. The use of descriptive variable names and standard Java library methods enhances readability.","tokens":289,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and efficient, using modulo operations to handle month wrapping. The variable names are clear, and the logic is easy to follow. The use of ENUMS array makes the code more readable and maintainable.","tokens":262,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
