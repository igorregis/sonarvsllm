{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses descriptive variable names, making it easy to understand the logic. The use of the modulo operator (%) for calculating the month is clear and efficient. However, the lack of context for the \u0027menta\u0027 method makes it slightly harder to fully grasp the code\u0027s purpose.","tokens":257,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is concise and uses a ternary operator for a clear conditional calculation. The method name \u0027getBrocolis\u0027 is a bit odd, but the logic is straightforward.  The use of \u0027d\u0027 suffix for the literal 0.0 is a good practice for clarity.","tokens":267,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is difficult to understand due to the complex logic and cryptic variable names. The nested loops and string manipulations make it hard to follow the flow of the algorithm. Using more descriptive variable names and breaking down the logic into smaller functions would significantly improve readability.","tokens":519,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses very confusing variable names (abobora, alhoPoro, feijaoVerde) making it extremely difficult to understand the logic. The use of magic numbers (DynamicTreeNode.GRAO_DE_BICO) and unclear variable types (aspargos) further hinders comprehension.","tokens":506,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is very cryptic and difficult to understand. It uses obscure variable names like \u0027tomilho\u0027, \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, and \u0027ordinal\u0027. The logic is also unclear, making it hard to decipher the code\u0027s purpose.","tokens":246,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The logic for determining leap years is clear and concise, using modulo operations for checking divisibility. The use of parentheses enhances readability by grouping the conditions. The code is also well-commented, making it easy to follow the logic.","tokens":292,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very readable and easy to understand. It uses clear variable names and a simple calculation. The use of a constant for PI makes the code more maintainable. The function is well-documented with a clear purpose and return value.","tokens":260,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is very readable and easy to understand. It has a clear function name, clear variable names, and a simple calculation. The code is well-formatted and easy to follow.","tokens":240,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is well-formatted and uses descriptive variable names, making it easy to understand the logic. However, the use of non-standard variable names like \u0027gengibre\u0027, \u0027pimenta\u0027, \u0027batata\u0027, etc., makes it slightly less readable. Overall, the code is clear and concise.","tokens":322,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses obscure variable names like \u0027nozMoscada\u0027, \u0027oregano\u0027, and \u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, making it difficult to understand the logic. The modulo operation and the addition of 12 within the array access are confusing and require careful analysis to decipher.","tokens":279,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
