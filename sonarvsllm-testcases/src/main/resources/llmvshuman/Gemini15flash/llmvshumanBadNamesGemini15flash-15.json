{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses meaningless variable names (paprica, alecrim, menta), making it very difficult to understand the purpose and functionality.  The logic, while concise, is obscure without context.  Better naming and comments would significantly improve readability.","tokens":246,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is concise but uses unclear variable names (getBrocolis, getEspinafre, getJaca).  While functional, the meaning is not immediately obvious without external context.  Better naming would significantly improve readability.","tokens":256,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is difficult to understand due to unclear variable names (p, s, d), nested loops, and complex string manipulations.  The logic for calculating the final result is not immediately apparent.  Better variable names and comments would significantly improve readability.","tokens":516,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses meaningless variable names (abobora, alhoPoro, etc.), making it extremely difficult to understand its purpose and logic.  The lack of comments further hinders comprehension.  The algorithm itself is unclear without context.","tokens":490,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is cryptic and uses unclear variable names (\u0027pimentaCaiena\u0027, \u0027tomilho\u0027).  The calculation `(ordinal() / 3) * 3` suggests potential for unexpected behavior due to integer division.  Lack of context makes understanding the purpose and functionality extremely difficult.","tokens":254,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and functional, clearly implementing a leap year check.  The boolean logic is easily understandable, although a simplified return statement (return (a % 4 \u003d\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 a % 100 !\u003d 0) || (a % 400 \u003d\u003d 0);) would improve readability slightly.","tokens":301,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is clean, concise, and easy to understand.  The use of a descriptive variable name (a for area) and a constant (P for Pi) enhances readability. The single function is focused and performs a simple calculation. Minor improvement could be using Math.PI instead of defining P.","tokens":272,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise, well-formatted, and easy to understand.  The variable names are clear (though \u0027a\u0027 and \u0027b\u0027 could be more descriptive). The calculation is straightforward. A minor improvement would be more descriptive variable names for better readability.","tokens":255,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"2","reasoning":"The code uses meaningless variable names (gengibre, pimenta, batata, etc.), making it impossible to understand its purpose or logic without external context.  Poor naming severely impacts readability and maintainability.","tokens":301,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code uses unclear variable names (nozMoscada, oregano, pimentaCaiena).  The logic, while functional, is not immediately obvious.  Improved naming and comments would significantly enhance readability and comprehension.","tokens":264,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
