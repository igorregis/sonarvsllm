{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-documented with clear Javadoc explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value.  The logic is concise and easy to understand, using the modulo operator effectively for cyclical month calculations. The immutability note is a good practice mention.","tokens":351,"name":"MonthSubtrai.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is concise, efficient, and well-documented.  The use of a ternary operator is clear and improves readability. The Javadoc is comprehensive, explaining the method\u0027s purpose, potential variations, and best practices.  A minor improvement could be to explicitly handle potential division by zero, although the current approach already does this.","tokens":383,"name":"GetMedia.java"}
{"score":"7","reasoning":"The code is functional and the Javadoc is helpful. However, the logic is implemented in a somewhat convoluted way, using String manipulations where integer arithmetic would be more efficient and readable.  The nested loops could be simplified.","tokens":942,"name":"CalculaDVBase10.java"}
{"score":"6","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks clarity. Variable names are somewhat descriptive (e.g.,  \u0027carregarFilhos\u0027), but comments are crucial for understanding the logic.  The inline comments are helpful, but the code could benefit from more descriptive variable names and potentially refactoring for better readability. The alternating color assignment is a bit obscure.","tokens":585,"name":"CarregarFilhos.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is concise and efficient. The Javadoc is clear and in Portuguese, which is good for a Portuguese-speaking audience.  The use of ENUMS and ordinal() is effective but might need a comment explaining the ENUMS array for better understanding by those unfamiliar with the context.","tokens":377,"name":"MonthPrimeiroMesDoTrimestre.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, uses clear variable names (ano), and has a concise, accurate comment explaining the leap year logic. The conditional logic is also easy to follow.  A minor improvement would be to simplify the return statement by removing the else block and directly returning the boolean expression result.","tokens":381,"name":"AnoBissexto.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-commented, uses a descriptive function name, and the logic is straightforward and easy to follow.  The use of a constant for PI is good practice. Minor improvement could be using Math.PI for better precision.","tokens":342,"name":"CalculaAreaCirculo.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, uses clear variable names, and has a concise, accurate Javadoc comment.  The formula is correctly implemented.  Minor improvement could be adding input validation to handle negative base or height.","tokens":341,"name":"CalculaAreaTrianguloIsoceles.java"}
{"score":"8","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand.  The Javadoc is clear and helpful. The variable names are descriptive. The logic is straightforward, combining statistics from another object.  Minor improvement could be adding inline comments explaining the purpose of sumWithCompensation.","tokens":360,"name":"Combine.java"}
{"score":"9","reasoning":"The code is well-commented, explaining its purpose and behavior clearly.  The use of modulo operator (%) for handling year rollover is efficient and elegant.  The immutability note is helpful.  Minor improvement could be adding a check for potential integer overflow if \u0027months\u0027 is extremely large.","tokens":381,"name":"MonthPlus.java"}
