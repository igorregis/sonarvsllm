{"score":"95","reasoning":"The code is clean, concise, and well-documented.  The docstring provides a clear explanation and a helpful example. The use of inheritance is appropriate.  Minor improvement could be adding a more descriptive name than \u0027AlreadyLocked\u0027, perhaps reflecting the specific locking mechanism.","tokens":273,"name":"snippets/python/70.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code is reasonably well-structured and uses meaningful variable names. However, the logic within the feed method is somewhat complex and could benefit from more comments to clarify the purpose of each section.  The use of magic numbers (e.g., constants from the \u0027constants\u0027 module) without clear inline explanation reduces readability.","tokens":744,"name":"snippets/python/4.jsnp"}
{"score":"60","reasoning":"The code has some readability issues.  The variable names are inconsistently capitalized (e.g., \u0027text\u0027, \u0027result\u0027, \u0027encoded\u0027). Comments are present but could be more precise and less conversational. The nested loop for encoding is a bit convoluted and could benefit from clearer structure and more descriptive variable names.  The overall logic is understandable but could be improved with better formatting and naming conventions.","tokens":803,"name":"snippets/python/75.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks clarity and efficiency.  The string manipulation in `conv_filename` is cumbersome. Error handling is basic.  Using more descriptive variable names and potentially refactoring into smaller functions would improve readability.","tokens":692,"name":"snippets/python/71.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The code is understandable but repetitive.  The same key-value pairs are assigned twice using different dictionaries (registry and en.directives).  Consolidating these assignments into a single dictionary would improve readability and maintainability.  The naming is also somewhat cryptic; more descriptive names would help.","tokens":356,"name":"snippets/python/83.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses clear docstrings to explain the purpose of the methods.  The names are descriptive, and the overall intent is easily understood. The use of \u0027pass\u0027 indicates incomplete implementation, which is acceptable for an abstract method definition.  A slight improvement would be adding more context about the \u0027topic hierarchy\u0027.","tokens":314,"name":"snippets/python/66.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code is relatively readable, with clear variable names (weekday, n). The use of try-except improves robustness. However, the  `__class__(self.weekday, n)`  in the else statement lacks context, making it slightly harder to understand its purpose without seeing the surrounding code.  More descriptive variable names and comments would enhance readability.","tokens":304,"name":"snippets/python/1.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and the docstring clearly explains its functionality.  The logic for handling commas and whitespace is correct and efficient.  Minor improvement could be using a more descriptive variable name than \u0027names\u0027.","tokens":450,"name":"snippets/python/22.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and documented, with clear variable names and a comprehensive docstring explaining its purpose and functionality. The use of descriptive variable names and comments enhances readability.  However, the code snippet is incomplete, ending abruptly, which slightly impacts the overall score.","tokens":681,"name":"snippets/python/44.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code is well-structured with clear variable names (mostly).  Error handling is present. However, the use of German variable names (\u0027Breite\u0027, \u0027Hoehe\u0027) reduces readability for non-German speakers.  Comments would improve understanding of the image scaling logic.","tokens":450,"name":"snippets/python/32.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code is generally well-structured and uses clear variable names.  Error handling is present, but the exception messages could be more informative. The use of xrange (Python 2) is outdated; it should be range.  Docstrings are helpful but could be more detailed about edge cases.","tokens":474,"name":"snippets/python/77.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code snippet demonstrates good commenting practices with clear version, author, and license information.  The import statements are a bit repetitive, and could be improved.  The class definition is straightforward, but lacks further implementation details for a complete evaluation.","tokens":483,"name":"snippets/python/48.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code is well-structured with clear method names and a logical flow.  However, error handling is missing, and the use of magic numbers (like \u00276\u0027 for nics) reduces readability.  Adding comments explaining the purpose of each method and variable would improve comprehension.","tokens":652,"name":"snippets/python/30.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses clear variable names.  The docstrings are helpful. However, the use of a dictionary \u0027totest\u0027 could be improved for better readability.  More descriptive variable names within the test cases would also enhance comprehension.","tokens":406,"name":"snippets/python/38.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code is relatively easy to understand.  The indentation is clear, and the logic is straightforward. However, it mixes presentation logic (HTML) with file system operations, which reduces readability and makes it harder to maintain.  More descriptive variable names would improve it.","tokens":324,"name":"snippets/python/117.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code is well-structured with clear method names and comments.  However, the use of magic numbers (dates) reduces readability.  More descriptive variable names and potentially using constants for dates would improve it. The test cases are comprehensive but could benefit from better organization or grouping for improved understanding.","tokens":1040,"name":"snippets/python/84.jsnp"}
{"score":"95","reasoning":"The code is clean, well-formatted, and easy to understand.  The use of a dictionary for language mappings is efficient and straightforward. The docstrings are helpful and concise.  Minor improvement could be adding comments explaining the purpose of the labels.","tokens":446,"name":"snippets/python/15.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code is reasonably well-structured and uses descriptive variable names.  However, some comments could be more precise, explaining the purpose of specific calculations or manipulations.  The class structure is clear, but the lack of detailed docstrings in methods reduces overall understanding.","tokens":472,"name":"snippets/python/40.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code snippet is well-formatted and uses clear variable names.  The use of i18n for translations is a plus. However, the long list of snooze choices could be improved with a more concise data structure or a loop for better readability.","tokens":621,"name":"snippets/python/109.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses clear variable names.  The use of Django\u0027s ORM is evident and generally considered good practice. However, the repetitive nature of the __unicode__ and Meta class definitions across multiple models suggests potential for refactoring into a base class to improve conciseness and maintainability.","tokens":413,"name":"snippets/python/45.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code demonstrates good structure with clear imports and class definitions.  Use of helper classes (relpath_to, collect_env_warnings) improves readability. However, some names could be more descriptive (e.g.,  ENV_PICKLE_FILENAME), and inline comments would enhance understanding in certain sections.","tokens":655,"name":"snippets/python/8.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses descriptive names.  Test methods are clear and concise. The use of assertIcon improves readability. Minor improvements could include more comments explaining complex logic or less common functions.","tokens":533,"name":"snippets/python/37.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code is mostly readable with clear comments explaining each step.
