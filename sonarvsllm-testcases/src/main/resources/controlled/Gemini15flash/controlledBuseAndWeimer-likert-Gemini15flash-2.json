{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code snippet is understandable but lacks context.  Variable names like \u0027mDevices\u0027, \u0027in\u0027, and \u0027num\u0027 are not self-explanatory.  The use of Vector is outdated; ArrayList would be preferred.  More information is needed to fully assess readability.","tokens":286,"name":"snippets/17.jsnp"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses descriptive variable names. The logic is clear and easy to follow.  The use of the for-each loop enhances readability. Minor improvements could be made to the method description creation for better clarity, but overall it\u0027s quite readable.","tokens":291,"name":"snippets/63.jsnp"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is well-formatted and uses clear variable names.  Comments are present to explain the purpose of each section. The inline comments explaining nullability are helpful.  Minor improvement could be adding more context about the purpose of the function addColumn.","tokens":301,"name":"snippets/54.jsnp"}
