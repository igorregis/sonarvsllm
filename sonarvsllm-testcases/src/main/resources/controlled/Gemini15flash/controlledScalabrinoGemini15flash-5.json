{"score":"95","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, readable, and efficient.  It handles null values correctly and uses clear variable names. The comments are helpful.  The logic for comparing CategoryDatasets is straightforward and easy to follow. Minor improvements could involve extracting some nested logic into smaller helper functions for better readability, but overall it\u0027s excellent.","tokens":531,"name":"snippets/40.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses descriptive variable names.  The comments are helpful, explaining the test\u0027s purpose and key steps. However, some parts could benefit from more concise naming (e.g., \u0027Another\u0027 could be more specific) and the assertion message is quite long.","tokens":476,"name":"snippets/179.jsnp"}
{"score":"60","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks clarity.  Variable names are not always descriptive (e.g., \u0027list\u0027, \u0027value\u0027).  The nested if-else structure and numerous method calls reduce readability.  Adding comments to explain the purpose of each section would significantly improve comprehension.","tokens":655,"name":"snippets/109.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code is reasonably well-structured but suffers from several readability issues.  The nested ifs and reliance on magic strings (\u0027incoming\u0027, \u0027outgoing\u0027) reduce clarity. The comment about the TODO and string creation origin further detracts.  Improved naming and comments would significantly enhance comprehension.","tokens":553,"name":"snippets/154.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code is functional but could be improved.  Using a Vector is outdated; ArrayList would be preferred.  The repeated calls to addElement() are verbose. A loop or array literal would be more concise and readable.  The Javadoc is clear.","tokens":472,"name":"snippets/45.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses descriptive variable names.  The logic is mostly clear, handling tooltip updates efficiently. However, the nested if/else structure could be slightly simplified, and the commented-out lines suggest potential for improvement or further context needed for a complete understanding.","tokens":469,"name":"snippets/122.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks clarity.  Method name `evalToString` is somewhat vague.  Nested `if` statements and reliance on external methods like `Model.getFacade()` reduce readability.  Adding comments explaining the purpose of each section would significantly improve the score.","tokens":489,"name":"snippets/8.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code uses long parameter names and nested loops, impacting readability.  Recursive calls to resolveEntityKey further complicate understanding. While the comments help, clearer variable names and potentially refactoring into smaller, more focused methods would improve comprehension.","tokens":552,"name":"snippets/197.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code is reasonably well-structured and uses descriptive variable names.  Error handling is present, though the exception messages could be more concise. The logic is clear, but the nested function calls (getSqlTypeCode) within the method could be simplified for better readability.","tokens":406,"name":"snippets/37.jsnp"}
{"score":"75","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses descriptive variable names.  The logic is clear, though the nested if-else structure could be slightly improved for better readability.  The use of helper methods like StringHelper and MockHelper improves modularity but requires understanding their functionality. Overall, it\u0027s understandable but could benefit from minor refactoring.","tokens":534,"name":"snippets/195.jsnp"}
{"score":"70","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses meaningful variable names.  However, the excessive use of comments, especially long separators, detracts from readability.  Breaking down the repetitive assertions into a loop would improve conciseness and maintainability.","tokens":668,"name":"snippets/17.jsnp"}
{"score":"60","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks clarity.  Long lines and repetitive calls to getAuditReader().getRevisions() reduce readability.  Using more descriptive variable names and potentially helper functions would improve comprehension and maintainability.","tokens":499,"name":"snippets/185.jsnp"}
{"score":"60","reasoning":"The code is functional but lacks clarity.  Excessive nested if-else statements reduce readability.  Extracting common logic into helper functions would significantly improve comprehension and maintainability.  More descriptive variable names would also help.","tokens":789,"name":"snippets/108.jsnp"}
{"score":"90","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and easy to understand.  Using StringBuilder for string concatenation is efficient.  Clear variable names enhance readability. Minor improvement:  Consider using a more concise formatting approach like String.format for better readability.","tokens":379,"name":"snippets/63.jsnp"}
{"score":"85","reasoning":"The code is well-structured and uses clear variable names.  The logic is easy to follow, handling different test types with if-else statements. The final else clause provides a fallback, enhancing robustness.  Minor improvement could be adding comments to clarify the purpose of some parts.","tokens":494,"name":"snippets/54.jsnp"}
