{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code snippet demonstrates some good practices (handling potential memory leaks), but the comments could be more descriptive.  The logic itself is straightforward, but explaining the purpose of \u0027importPackage\u0027 and its role within the larger system would enhance readability.","tokens":307,"name":"snippets/81.jsnp"}
{"score":"80","reasoning":"The code snippet demonstrates good readability. The use of descriptive variable names like \u0027returnType\u0027 and \u0027opcode\u0027 makes it easy to understand the purpose. The comments explaining the \u0027J\u0027 code for \u0027long\u0027 are helpful.  It would benefit from a more descriptive variable name than \u0027cv\u0027 and a bit more context on the purpose of this code.","tokens":286,"name":"snippets/61.jsnp"}
{"score":"80","reasoning":"This Java snippet demonstrates good readability. The switch statement clearly maps states to their string representations, making the logic easy to follow. Using named constants instead of magic numbers further enhances clarity.","tokens":247,"name":"snippets/89.jsnp"}
{"score":"65","reasoning":"The code snippet demonstrates clarity in handling different input types using instanceof checks and provides explicit error handling. However, the use of abbreviations like \u0027iterateOverMe\u0027 might hinder readability for others. Consider a more descriptive variable name.","tokens":279,"name":"snippets/31.jsnp"}
