{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is quite readable. It uses clear function names and consistent structure. The use of list comprehensions is concise and easy to understand. The logic is straightforward, processing children nodes and filtering based on type.","tokens":447,"name":"snippets/python/102.jsnp"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is mostly readable, with clear variable names and logical flow. However, the nested function `fieldNameIndex` and the logic within `findFieldName` are a bit complex and could be simplified for better readability. The `CanGoNext` method is reasonably clear, but the nested loops and conditional logic could be slightly more concise.","tokens":531,"name":"snippets/python/0.jsnp"}
{"score":"3","reasoning":"The code is mostly readable, using descriptive variable names like \u0027textfile\u0027, \u0027contents\u0027, and \u0027imgname\u0027. However, the logic within the loop could be slightly clearer with comments, especially the magic numbers 4 and 2. The use of \u0027T\u0027 as a list name is not very descriptive. The try/except block is good practice.","tokens":559,"name":"snippets/python/64.jsnp"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is reasonably readable. It uses clear variable names and has a straightforward structure. The regular expressions are a bit complex but are clearly defined. The logic is easy to follow, and the code is well-organized into a function and a main execution block. The use of list comprehension could improve readability slightly.","tokens":859,"name":"snippets/python/18.jsnp"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is well-structured with clear comments explaining each step. It uses descriptive variable names and has a logical flow. The use of helper functions like `status_iterator` and `collect_env_warnings` enhances readability. The `NotImplementedError` for abstract methods is also good practice.","tokens":626,"name":"snippets/python/42.jsnp"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is reasonably readable. It uses clear variable names and comments to explain the purpose of the functions and the decorator. The logic flow is easy to follow, and the use of a custom event class enhances clarity. The synchronized decorator is also well-defined and easy to understand.","tokens":480,"name":"snippets/python/12.jsnp"}
