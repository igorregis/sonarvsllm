{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is quite readable. It uses clear method names and assertions. The repeated structure makes it easy to follow. The use of constants could improve it slightly, but overall it\u0027s well-structured.","tokens":510,"name":"snippets/185.jsnp"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is well-structured with clear if-else blocks handling different property names. It uses meaningful variable names and throws exceptions with informative messages. The logic is straightforward to follow, although the repeated structure could potentially be refactored for better maintainability.","tokens":810,"name":"snippets/108.jsnp"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is quite readable. It uses a StringBuilder for efficient string concatenation, and the chained appends make it easy to follow the structure of the output. The variable names are descriptive, and the overall logic is straightforward.","tokens":386,"name":"snippets/63.jsnp"}
{"score":"4","reasoning":"The code is generally readable with clear if-else structure handling different test types. Variable names are descriptive. The logic for handling TestSuite with recursion is a bit complex but understandable. Could be improved with more comments.","tokens":490,"name":"snippets/54.jsnp"}
