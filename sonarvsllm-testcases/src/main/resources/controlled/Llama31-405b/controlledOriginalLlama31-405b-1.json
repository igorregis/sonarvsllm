{"score":"95","reasoning":"The code is well-structured, readable, and follows standard Java conventions. The use of enums, switch statements, and method overriding is clear and concise. The comments and Javadoc provide excellent explanations of the code\u0027s purpose and functionality. However, some methods are quite long and complex, which might make them harder to understand and maintain. Additionally, there are some repeated calculations in the length() and firstDayOfYear() methods that could be extracted into separate methods for better readability and reusability.","tokens":5185,"sonarData":{"component":{"id":"AY6rXgee5TSJU2eSNDy_","key":"igorregis_sonarvsllm:src/main/java/java/classes/Month.java","name":"Month.java","qualifier":"FIL","path":"src/main/java/java/classes/Month.java","language":"java","measures":[{"metric":"complexity","value":"49","bestValue":false},{"metric":"code_smells","value":"3","bestValue":false},{"metric":"cognitive_complexity","value":"16","bestValue":false},{"metric":"files","value":"1","bestValue":false},{"metric":"statements","value":"43","bestValue":false},{"metric":"comment_lines_density","value":"63.4","bestValue":false},{"metric":"lines","value":"526","bestValue":false},{"metric":"sqale_rating","value":"1.0","bestValue":true}]}}}
